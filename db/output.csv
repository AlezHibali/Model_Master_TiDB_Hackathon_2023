We release a smaller 3B variant of the LongLLaMA model on a permissive license (Apache 2.0) and inference code supporting longer contexts on Hugging Face. Our model weights can serve as the drop-in replacement of LLaMA in existing implementations (for short context up to 2048 tokens). Additionally, we provide evaluation results and comparisons against the original OpenLLaMA models. Stay tuned for further updates.; Focused Transformer: Contrastive Training for Context Scaling (FoT) presents a simple method for endowing language models with the ability to handle context consisting possibly of millions of tokens while training on significantly shorter input. FoT permits a subset of attention layers to access a memory cache of (key, value) pairs to extend the context length. The distinctive aspect of FoT is its training procedure, drawing from contrastive learning. Specifically, we deliberately expose the memory attention layers to both relevant and irrelevant keys (like negative samples from unrelated documents). This strategy incentivizes the model to differentiate keys connected with semantically diverse values, thereby enhancing their structure. This, in turn, makes it possible to extrapolate the effective context length much beyond what is seen in training. ",Natural Language Processing

The method works by posing the sequence to be classified as the NLI premise and to construct a hypothesis from each candidate label. For example, if we want to evaluate whether a sequence belongs to the class ""politics"", we could construct a hypothesis of This text is about politics.. The probabilities for entailment and contradiction are then converted to label probabilities.; This method is surprisingly effective in many cases, particularly when used with larger pre-trained models like BART and Roberta. See this blog post for a more expansive introduction to this and other zero shot methods, and see the code snippets below for examples of using this model for zero-shot classification both with Hugging Face's built-in pipeline and with native Transformers/PyTorch code.; The model can be loaded with the zero-shot-classification pipeline like so:",Natural Language Processing

StarChat-β is the second model in the series, and is a fine-tuned version of StarCoderPlus that was trained on an ""uncensored"" variant of the openassistant-guanaco dataset. We found that removing the in-built alignment of the OpenAssistant dataset boosted performance on the Open LLM Leaderboard and made the model more helpful at coding tasks. However, this means that model is likely to generate problematic text when prompted to do so and should only be used for educational and research purposes.; The model was fine-tuned on a variant of the OpenAssistant/oasst1 dataset, which contains a diverse range of dialogues in over 35 languages. As a result, the model can be used for chat and you can check out our demo to test its coding capabilities. ; Here's how you can run the model using the pipeline() function from ? Transformers:; StarChat-β has not been aligned to human preferences with techniques like RLHF or deployed with in-the-loop filtering of responses like ChatGPT, so the model can produce problematic outputs (especially when prompted to do so). 
Models trained primarily on code data will also have a more skewed demographic bias commensurate with the demographics of the GitHub community, for more on this see the StarCoder dataset which is derived from The Stack.; Since the base model was pretrained on a large corpus of code, it may produce code snippets that are syntactically valid but semantically incorrect.

The Stable Diffusion 2.1 version is marginally more effective, as it was developed to address my specific needs. However, this 1.5 version model was also trained on the same dataset for those who are using the older version.; These models perform quite well in most cases, but please note that they are not 100% accurate. In some instances, the QR code shape might not come through as expected. You can increase the ControlNet weight to emphasize the QR code shape. However, be cautious as this might negatively impact the style of your output.To optimize for scanning, please generate your QR codes with correction mode 'H' (30%).; To balance between style and shape, a gentle fine-tuning of the control weight might be required based on the individual input and the desired output, aswell as the correct prompt. Some prompts do not work until you increase the weight by a lot. The process of finding the right balance between these factors is part art and part science. For the best results, it is recommended to generate your artwork at a resolution of 768. This allows for a higher level of detail in the final product, enhancing the quality and effectiveness of the QR code-based artwork.; The simplest way to use this is to place the .safetensors model and its .yaml config file in the folder where your other controlnet models are installed, which varies per application. 
For usage in auto1111 they can be placed in the webui/models/ControlNet folder. They can be loaded using the controlnet webui extension which you can install through the extensions tab in the webui (https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet). Make sure to enable your controlnet unit and set your input image as the QR code. Set the model to either the SD2.1 or 1.5 version depending on your base stable diffusion model, or it will error. No pre-processor is needed, though you can use the invert pre-processor for a different variation of results. 768 is the preferred resolution for generation since it allows for more detail.
Make sure to look up additional info on how to use controlnet if you get stuck, once you have the webui up and running its really easy to install the controlnet extension aswell.",Computer Vision

However, the development of LLMs has been primarily focused on high-resource languages, such as English, thereby limiting their applicability and research in other languages. Consequently, we present PolyLM, a multilingual LLM trained on 640 billion (B) tokens, avaliable in two model sizes: 1.7B and 13B. To enhance its multilingual capabilities, we 1) integrate bilingual data into training data; and 2) adopt a curriculum learning strategy that increases the proportion of non-English data from 30% in the first stage to 60% in the final stage during pre-training. Further, we propose a multilingual self-instruct method which automatically generates 132.7K  diverse multilingual instructions for model fine-tuning. To assess the model's performance, we collect several existing multilingual tasks, including multilingual understanding, question answering, generation, and translation.

The main rationale for this are the observations from Zhou et al.. The authors suggested that just 1000-2000 carefully curated training examples may yield high quality output for assistant-type chatbots. This is in contrast with the commonly employed strategy where a very large number of training examples (tens of thousands to even millions) of widely varying quality are used.; For LIMARP a similar approach was used, with the difference that the conversational data is almost entirely human-generated.

However, most existing pre-trained models only excel in either understanding-based tasks or generation-based tasks. Furthermore, performance improvement has been largely achieved by scaling up the dataset with noisy image-text pairs collected from the web, which is a suboptimal source of supervision. In this paper, we propose BLIP, a new VLP framework which transfers flexibly to both vision-language understanding and generation tasks. BLIP effectively utilizes the noisy web data by bootstrapping the captions, where a captioner generates synthetic captions and a filter removes the noisy ones. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of vision-language tasks, such as image-text retrieval (+2.7% in average recall@1), image captioning (+2.8% in CIDEr), and VQA (+1.6% in VQA score). BLIP also demonstrates strong generalization ability when directly transferred to videolanguage tasks in a zero-shot manner.

Model performance measures: NLLB-200 model was evaluated using BLEU, spBLEU, and chrF++ metrics widely adopted by machine translation community. Additionally, we performed human evaluation with the XSTS protocol and measured the toxicity of the generated translations.; ? We used parallel multilingual data from a variety of sources to train the model. We provide detailed report on data selection and construction process in Section 5 in the paper. We also used monolingual data constructed from Common Crawl. We provide more details in Section 5.2.; ? In this work, we took a reflexive approach in technological development to ensure that we prioritize human users and minimize risks that could be transferred to them. While we reflect on our ethical considerations throughout the article, here are some additional points to highlight. For one, many languages chosen for this study are low-resource languages, with a heavy emphasis on African languages. While quality translation could improve education and information access in many in these communities, such an access could also make groups with lower levels of digital literacy more vulnerable to misinformation or online scams. The latter scenarios could arise if bad actors misappropriate our work for nefarious activities, which we conceive as an example of unintended use. Regarding data acquisition, the training data used for model development were mined from various publicly available sources on the web. Although we invested heavily in data cleaning, personally identifiable information may not be entirely eliminated. Finally, although we did our best to optimize for translation quality, mistranslations produced by the model could remain. Although the odds are low, this could have adverse impact on those who rely on these translations to make important decisions (particularly when related to health and safety).",Natural Language Processing

The license used is MIT.; Motivated by the success of T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) in pre-trained natural language processing models, we propose a unified-modal SpeechT5 framework that explores the encoder-decoder pre-training for self-supervised speech/text representation learning. The SpeechT5 framework consists of a shared encoder-decoder network and six modal-specific (speech/text) pre/post-nets. After preprocessing the input speech/text through the pre-nets, the shared encoder-decoder network models the sequence-to-sequence transformation, and then the post-nets generate the output in the speech/text modality based on the output of the decoder.; Leveraging large-scale unlabeled speech and text data, we pre-train SpeechT5 to learn a unified-modal representation, hoping to improve the modeling capability for both speech and text. To align the textual and speech information into this unified semantic space, we propose a cross-modal vector quantization approach that randomly mixes up speech/text states with latent units as the interface between encoder and decoder.",Audio

We excluded cells with high mutational burdens (e.g. malignant cells and immortalized cell lines) that could lead to substantial network rewiring without companion genome sequencing to facilitate interpretation. Each single cell’s transcriptome is presented to the model as a rank value encoding where genes are ranked by their expression in that cell normalized by their expression across the entire Genecorpus-30M. The rank value encoding provides a nonparametric representation of that cell’s transcriptome and takes advantage of the many observations of each gene’s expression across Genecorpus-30M to prioritize genes that distinguish cell state. Specifically, this method will deprioritize ubiquitously highly-expressed housekeeping genes by normalizing them to a lower rank. Conversely, genes such as transcription factors that may be lowly expressed when they are expressed but highly distinguish cell state will move to a higher rank within the encoding. Furthermore, this rank-based approach may be more robust against technical artifacts that may systematically bias the absolute transcript counts value while the overall relative ranking of genes within each cell remains more stable. ; The rank value encoding of each single cell’s transcriptome then proceeds through six transformer encoder units. Pretraining was accomplished using a masked learning objective where 15% of the genes within each transcriptome were masked and the model was trained to predict which gene should be within each masked position in that specific cell state using the context of the remaining unmasked genes. A major strength of this approach is that it is entirely self-supervised and can be accomplished on completely unlabeled data, which allows the inclusion of large amounts of training data without being restricted to samples with accompanying labels.; We detail applications and results in our manuscript.

with an encoder-decoder architecture that can flexibly operate in different modes (i.e. encoder-only, decoder-only,
and encoder-decoder) to support a wide range of code understanding and generation tasks.
It is introduced in the paper:; CodeT5+: Open Code Large Language Models for Code Understanding and Generation
by Yue Wang*, Hung Le*, Akhilesh Deepak Gotmare, Nghi D.Q. Bui, Junnan Li, Steven C.H. Hoi (*
indicates equal contribution).; Compared to the original CodeT5 family (base: 220M, large: 770M), CodeT5+ is pretrained with a diverse set of
pretraining tasks including span denoising, causal language modeling, contrastive learning, and text-code
matching to learn rich representations from both unimodal code data and bimodal code-text data.
Additionally, it employs a simple yet effective compute-efficient pretraining method to initialize the model
components with frozen off-the-shelf LLMs such as CodeGen to efficiently scale
up the model (i.e. 2B, 6B, 16B), and adopts a ""shallow encoder and deep decoder"" architecture.
Furthermore, it is instruction-tuned to align with natural language instructions (see our InstructCodeT5+ 16B)
following Code Alpaca.; This checkpoint consists of an encoder of CodeT5+ 220M model (pretrained from 2 stages on both unimodal and bimodal) and a projection layer, which can be used to extract code
embeddings of 256 dimension. It can be easily loaded using the AutoModel functionality and employs the
same CodeT5 tokenizer.; This checkpoint is trained on the stricter permissive subset of the deduplicated version of
the github-code dataset.
The data is preprocessed by reserving only permissively licensed code (""mit"" “apache-2”, “bsd-3-clause”, “bsd-2-clause”,
“cc0-1.0”, “unlicense”, “isc”).
Supported languages (9 in total) are as follows:
c, c++, c-sharp,  go, java, javascript,  php, python, ruby.",

It was introduced in Multilingual Translation with Extensible Multilingual Pretraining and Finetuning paper.; mBART-50 is a multilingual Sequence-to-Sequence model. It was introduced to show that multilingual translation models can be created through multilingual fine-tuning. 
Instead of fine-tuning on one direction, a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on many directions simultaneously. mBART-50 is created using the original mBART model and extended to add extra 25 languages to support multilingual machine translation models of 50 languages. The pre-training objective is explained below.; Multilingual Denoising Pretraining: The model incorporates N languages by concatenating data: 
D = {D1, ..., DN } where each Di is a collection of monolingual documents in language i. The source documents are noised using two schemes, 
first randomly shuffling the original sentences' order, and second a novel in-filling scheme, 
where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. The model is then tasked to reconstruct the original text. 
35% of each instance's words are masked by random sampling a span length according to a Poisson distribution (λ = 3.5).
The decoder input is the original text with one position offset. A language id symbol LID is used as the initial token to predict the sentence.; mbart-large-50 is pre-trained model and primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on translation tasks. It can also be fine-tuned on other multilingual sequence-to-sequence tasks. 
See the model hub to look for fine-tuned versions.; As the model is multilingual, it expects the sequences in a different format. A special language id token is used as a prefix in both the source and target text.

However, most existing pre-trained models only excel in either understanding-based tasks or generation-based tasks. Furthermore, performance improvement has been largely achieved by scaling up the dataset with noisy image-text pairs collected from the web, which is a suboptimal source of supervision. In this paper, we propose BLIP, a new VLP framework which transfers flexibly to both vision-language understanding and generation tasks. BLIP effectively utilizes the noisy web data by bootstrapping the captions, where a captioner generates synthetic captions and a filter removes the noisy ones. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of vision-language tasks, such as image-text retrieval (+2.7% in average recall@1), image captioning (+2.8% in CIDEr), and VQA (+1.6% in VQA score).

and objectives. We present Pix2Struct, a pretrained image-to-text model for
purely visual language understanding, which can be finetuned on tasks containing visually-situated language. Pix2Struct is pretrained by learning to parse
masked screenshots of web pages into simplified HTML. The web, with its richness of visual elements cleanly reflected in the HTML structure, provides a large
source of pretraining data well suited to the diversity of downstream tasks. Intuitively, this objective subsumes common pretraining signals such as OCR, language modeling, image captioning. In addition to the novel pretraining strategy,
we introduce a variable-resolution input representation and a more flexible integration of language and vision inputs, where language prompts such as questions
are rendered directly on top of the input image. For the first time, we show that a
single pretrained model can achieve state-of-the-art results in six out of nine tasks

Comprehending plots and charts requires strong reasoning skills. Prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) models require at least tens of thousands of training examples and their reasoning capabilities are still much limited, especially on complex human-written queries. This paper presents the first one-shot solution to visual language reasoning. We decompose the challenge of visual language reasoning into two steps: (1) plot-to-text translation, and (2) reasoning over the translated text. The key in this method is a modality conversion module, named as DePlot, which translates the image of a plot or chart to a linearized table. The output of DePlot can then be directly used to prompt a pretrained large language model (LLM), exploiting the few-shot reasoning capabilities of LLMs. To obtain DePlot, we standardize the plot-to-table task by establishing unified task formats and metrics, and train DePlot end-to-end on this task. DePlot can then be used off-the-shelf together with LLMs in a plug-and-play fashion. Compared with a SOTA model finetuned on more than >28k data points, DePlot+LLM with just one-shot prompting achieves a 24.0% improvement over finetuned SOTA on human-written queries from the task of chart QA.; You can run a prediction by querying an input image together with a question as follows:; You can use the convert_pix2struct_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py script as follows:",Multimodel

It is based on the Guanaco LORA of LLaMA weighing in at 65B parameters. 
The primary goal of this model is to improve question-answering and medical dialogue tasks.
It was trained using LoRA and quantized, to reduce memory footprint. ; Steps to load this model:; The following README is taken from the source page medalpaca; The training data for this project was sourced from various resources. 
Firstly, we used Anki flashcards to automatically generate questions, 
from the front of the cards and anwers from the back of the card. 
Secondly, we generated medical question-answer pairs from Wikidoc. 
We extracted paragraphs with relevant headings, and used Chat-GPT 3.5 
to generate questions from the headings and using the corresponding paragraphs 
as answers. This dataset is still under development and we believe 
that approximately 70% of these question answer pairs are factual correct. 
Thirdly, we used StackExchange to extract question-answer pairs, taking the 
top-rated question from five categories: Academia, Bioinformatics, Biology, 
Fitness, and Health. Additionally, we used a dataset from ChatDoctor 
consisting of 200,000 question-answer pairs, available at https://github.com/Kent0n-Li/ChatDoctor.",Natural Language Processing

The Stable Diffusion 2.1 version is marginally more effective, as it was developed to address my specific needs. However, a 1.5 version model was also trained on the same dataset for those who are using the older version.; These models perform quite well in most cases, but please note that they are not 100% accurate. In some instances, the QR code shape might not come through as expected. You can increase the ControlNet weight to emphasize the QR code shape. However, be cautious as this might negatively impact the style of your output.To optimize for scanning, please generate your QR codes with correction mode 'H' (30%).; To balance between style and shape, a gentle fine-tuning of the control weight might be required based on the individual input and the desired output, aswell as the correct prompt. Some prompts do not work until you increase the weight by a lot. The process of finding the right balance between these factors is part art and part science. For the best results, it is recommended to generate your artwork at a resolution of 768. This allows for a higher level of detail in the final product, enhancing the quality and effectiveness of the QR code-based artwork.; The simplest way to use this is to place the .safetensors model and its .yaml config file in the folder where your other controlnet models are installed, which varies per application. 
For usage in auto1111 they can be placed in the webui/models/ControlNet folder. They can be loaded using the controlnet webui extension which you can install through the extensions tab in the webui (https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet). Make sure to enable your controlnet unit and set your input image as the QR code. Set the model to either the SD2.1 or 1.5 version depending on your base stable diffusion model, or it will error. No pre-processor is needed, though you can use the invert pre-processor for a different variation of results. 768 is the preferred resolution for generation since it allows for more detail.
Make sure to look up additional info on how to use controlnet if you get stuck, once you have the webui up and running its really easy to install the controlnet extension aswell.",Computer Vision

It was introduced in Shap-E: Generating Conditional 3D Implicit Functions by Heewoo Jun and Alex Nichol from OpenAI. ; Original repository of Shap-E can be found here: https://github.com/openai/shap-e. ; The authors of Shap-E didn't author this model card. They provide a separate model card here.; The abstract of the Shap-E paper:; We present Shap-E, a conditional generative model for 3D assets. Unlike recent work on 3D generative models which produce a single output representation, Shap-E directly generates the parameters of implicit functions that can be rendered as both textured meshes and neural radiance fields. We train Shap-E in two stages: first, we train an encoder that deterministically maps 3D assets into the parameters of an implicit function; second, we train a conditional diffusion model on outputs of the encoder. When trained on a large dataset of paired 3D and text data, our resulting models are capable of generating complex and diverse 3D assets in a matter of seconds. When compared to Point-E, an explicit generative model over point clouds, Shap-E converges faster and reaches comparable or better sample quality despite modeling a higher-dimensional, multi-representation output space. We release model weights, inference code, and samples at this https URL.",Multimodel

This dataset underwent a comprehensive revision, replacing every single answer with those generated by GPT-4.; The volume of the datasets has also been augmented by approximately 50%, with a particular focus on high school and abstract algebra. This expansion leveraged the combined capabilities of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo. The initial evaluation of algebraic functions over 12 epochs indicated promising results from this enriched dataset. However, this is just the beginning; further refinements are in the pipeline, aiming to optimize the dataset quality and subsequently decrease the number of epochs required to achieve comparable results.; Considering the need to curtail memory consumption during training, this dataset was tailored to consist solely of English language questions and answers.

Natural language processing stands to help address these issues by automatically defining unfamiliar terms. We introduce a new task and dataset for defining scientific terms and controlling the complexity of gen- erated definitions as a way of adapting to a specific reader’s background knowledge. We test four definition generation methods for this new task, finding that a sequence-to-sequence approach is most successful. We then explore the version of the task in which definitions are generated at a target complexity level. We in- troduce a novel reranking approach and find in human evaluations that it offers superior fluency while also controlling complexity, compared to several controllable generation baselines.; The model is finetuned on the task of generating definitions of scientific terms. We frame our task as generating an answer to the question “What is (are) X?” Along with the question, the model takes a support document of scientific abstracted related to the term being defined.

Note that longer training with more epochs hurt performance in my tests (overfitting).; The model was evaluated using the test sets for MultiNLI, ANLI, LingNLI, WANLI and the dev set for Fever-NLI. The metric used is accuracy.
The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on each dataset. Surprisingly, it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on ANLI (ALBERT-XXL) by 8,3%. I assume that this is because ANLI was created to fool masked language models like RoBERTa (or ALBERT), while DeBERTa-v3 uses a better pre-training objective (RTD), disentangled attention and I fine-tuned it on higher quality NLI data.

We used parallel multilingual data from a variety of sources to train the model. We provide detailed report on data selection and construction process in Section 5 in the paper. We also used monolingual data constructed from Common Crawl. We provide more details in Section 5.2.; ? In this work, we took a reflexive approach in technological development to ensure that we prioritize human users and minimize risks that could be transferred to them. While we reflect on our ethical considerations throughout the article, here are some additional points to highlight. For one, many languages chosen for this study are low-resource languages, with a heavy emphasis on African languages. While quality translation could improve education and information access in many in these communities, such an access could also make groups with lower levels of digital literacy more vulnerable to misinformation or online scams. The latter scenarios could arise if bad actors misappropriate our work for nefarious activities, which we conceive as an example of unintended use. Regarding data acquisition, the training data used for model development were mined from various publicly available sources on the web. Although we invested heavily in data cleaning, personally identifiable information may not be entirely eliminated. Finally, although we did our best to optimize for translation quality, mistranslations produced by the model could remain. Although the odds are low, this could have adverse impact on those who rely on these translations to make important decisions (particularly when related to health and safety).",Natural Language Processing

Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve a new state of the art for image inpainting and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, semantic scene synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs.; Authors; Robin Rombach, Andreas Blattmann, Dominik Lorenz, Patrick Esser, Bj?rn Ommer",

Our objective is to make scientific knowledge universally accessible. If you have already experimented with our baseline model (sas_baseline), you will find that the current model surpasses its predecessor in terms of all evaluation metrics. Feel free to test it via the Hosted Inference API to your right. Simply select one of the provided examples or input your own scientific abstract. Just ensure to precede your text with the instruction, ""summarize, simplify, and contextualize: "", followed by a space. For local usage, refer to the Usage section.""; Open science has significantly reduced barriers to accessing scientific papers.
However, attainable research does not entail accessible knowledge.
Consequently, many individuals might prefer to rely on succinct social media narratives rather than endeavour to comprehend a scientific paper.
This preference is understandable as humans often favor narratives over dry, technical information. 
So, why not ""translate"" these intricate scientific abstracts into simpler, more accessible narratives? 
Several prestigious journals have already initiated steps towards enhancing accessibility. 
For instance, PNAS requires authors to submit Significance Statements understandable to an 'undergraduate-educated scientist', while Science includes an editor's abstract to provide a swift overview of the paper's salient points.; In this project, our objective is to employ AI to rewrite scientific abstracts into easily understandable scientific narratives.
To facilitate this, we have curated two new datasets: one containing PNAS abstract-significance pairs and the other encapsulating editor abstracts from Science.
We utilize a Transformer model (a variant known as Flan-T5) to fine-tune our model for the task of simplifying scientific abstracts.
Initially, the model is fine-tuned utilizing multiple discrete instructions by amalgamating four pertinent tasks in a challenge-proportional manner (a strategy we refer to as Multi-Instruction Pretuning).
Subsequently, we continue the fine-tuning process exclusively with the abstract-significance corpus. Our model can generate lay summaries that outperform models fine-tuned solely with the abstract-significance corpus and models fine-tuned with traditional task combinations.
We hope our work can foster a more comprehensive understanding of scientific research, enabling a larger audience to benefit from open science.; Use the code below to get started with the model. Remember to prepend the INSTRUCTION for best performance.; We finetuned the base model (flan-t5-large) on multiple relevant tasks with standard language modeling loss. During training, the source text of each task is prepended with an task-specific instruction and mapped to the corresponding target text.

Among the two main branches of pre-trained language models in the general language domain, i.e. BERT (and its variants) and GPT (and its variants), the first one has been extensively studied in the biomedical domain, such as BioBERT and PubMedBERT. While they have achieved great success on a variety of discriminative downstream biomedical tasks, the lack of generation ability constrains their application scope. In this paper, we propose BioGPT, a domain-specific generative Transformer language model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical literature. We evaluate BioGPT on six biomedical natural language processing tasks and demonstrate that our model outperforms previous models on most tasks. Especially, we get 44.98%, 38.42% and 40.76% F1 score on BC5CDR, KD-DTI and DDI end-to-end relation extraction tasks, respectively, and 78.2% accuracy on PubMedQA, creating a new record. Our case study on text generation further demonstrates the advantage of BioGPT on biomedical literature to generate fluent descriptions for biomedical terms.; If you find BioGPT useful in your research, please cite the following paper:",Natural Language Processing

e621.net, a rich resource of millions of hand-labeled artworks, each of which is both human-labeled topically and rated 
according to its quality.  E621.net allows users to express their approval of an artwork by either up-voting it, or marking it as a favorite.Boring_e621 was specifically trained on artworks automatically selected from the site according to the criteria 
that no user has ever Favorited or Up-Voted them.  boring_e621 thus learned to produce low-quality images, so when it is 
used in the negative prompt of a stable diffusion image generator, the model avoids making mistakes that would make the generation more boring.

and objectives. We present Pix2Struct, a pretrained image-to-text model for
purely visual language understanding, which can be finetuned on tasks containing visually-situated language. Pix2Struct is pretrained by learning to parse
masked screenshots of web pages into simplified HTML. The web, with its richness of visual elements cleanly reflected in the HTML structure, provides a large
source of pretraining data well suited to the diversity of downstream tasks. Intuitively, this objective subsumes common pretraining signals such as OCR, language modeling, image captioning. In addition to the novel pretraining strategy,
we introduce a variable-resolution input representation and a more flexible integration of language and vision inputs, where language prompts such as questions
are rendered directly on top of the input image. For the first time, we show that a
single pretrained model can achieve state-of-the-art results in six out of nine tasks

It is based on LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) and contains 7 billion parameters. 
The primary goal of this model is to improve question-answering and medical dialogue tasks.
It was trained using LoRA and quantized, to reduce memory footprint. ; The training data for this project was sourced from various resources. 
Firstly, we used Anki flashcards to automatically generate questions, 
from the front of the cards and anwers from the back of the card. 
Secondly, we generated medical question-answer pairs from Wikidoc. 
We extracted paragraphs with relevant headings, and used Chat-GPT 3.5 
to generate questions from the headings and using the corresponding paragraphs 
as answers. This dataset is still under development and we believe 
that approximately 70% of these question answer pairs are factual correct. 
Thirdly, we used StackExchange to extract question-answer pairs, taking the 
top-rated question from five categories: Academia, Bioinformatics, Biology, 
Fitness, and Health. Additionally, we used a dataset from ChatDoctor 
consisting of 200,000 question-answer pairs, available at https://github.com/Kent0n-Li/ChatDoctor.; The model may not perform effectively outside the scope of the medical domain.
The training data primarily targets the knowledge level of medical students, 
which may result in limitations when addressing the needs of board-certified physicians.
The model has not been tested in real-world applications, so its efficacy and accuracy are currently unknown. 
It should never be used as a substitute for a doctor's opinion and must be treated as a research tool only.",Natural Language Processing

The goal of this test was to explore the potential of the BLOOM architecture for language modeling tasks that require instruction-based responses.; To achieve this goal, we used a pre-trained LLM model with limited training, and fine-tuned it using a dataset of naive translations of instruction-based content. The dataset was created by taking instructions in English and translating them into German using an automated translation tool. While this approach may introduce errors in the translated content, we wanted to test whether the model could still learn to generate instruction-based responses in a variety of languages.; instruct-igel-001 is trained on naive translated instruction datasets, without much post-processing.

However, state-of-the-art visionlanguage models do not perform well on these data. We propose MATCHA (Math reasoning and Chart derendering pretraining) to enhance visual language models’ capabilities jointly modeling charts/plots and language data. Specifically we propose several pretraining tasks that cover plot deconstruction and numerical reasoning which are the key capabilities in visual language modeling. We perform the MATCHA pretraining starting from Pix2Struct, a recently proposed imageto-text visual language model. On standard benchmarks such as PlotQA and ChartQA, MATCHA model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by as much as nearly 20%. We also examine how well MATCHA pretraining transfers to domains such as screenshot, textbook diagrams, and document figures and observe overall improvement, verifying the usefulness of MATCHA pretraining on broader visual language tasks.; You should ask specific questions to the model in order to get consistent generations.

by Yue Wang*, Hung Le*, Akhilesh Deepak Gotmare, Nghi D.Q. Bui, Junnan Li, Steven C.H. Hoi (* indicates equal contribution).; Compared to the original CodeT5 family (base: 220M, large: 770M), CodeT5+ is pretrained with a diverse set of pretraining tasks including span denoising, causal language modeling, contrastive learning, and text-code matching to learn rich representations from both unimodal code data and bimodal code-text data. 
Additionally, it employs a simple yet effective compute-efficient pretraining method to initialize the model components with frozen off-the-shelf LLMs such as CodeGen to efficiently scale up the model (i.e. 2B, 6B, 16B), and adopts a ""shallow encoder and deep decoder"" architecture. 
Furthermore, it is instruction-tuned to align with natural language instructions (see our InstructCodeT5+ 16B) following Code Alpaca.  ; This model can be easily loaded using the AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM functionality and employs the same tokenizer as CodeGen.; This checkpoint is trained on the stricter permissive subset of the deduplicated version of the github-code dataset.
The data is preprocessed by reserving only permissively licensed code (""mit"" “apache-2”, “bsd-3-clause”, “bsd-2-clause”, “cc0-1.0”, “unlicense”, “isc”).

However, many LLMs especially the open-sourced ones, such as BLOOM and LLaMA, are English-dominant and support only dozens of natural languages, making the potential of LLMs on language translation less explored. In this work, we present BigTranslate which adapts LLaMA that covers only 20 languages and enhances it with multilingual translation capability on more than 100 languages. BigTranslate is built upon LLaMA-13B and it is optimized in three steps. First, we continue training LLaMA with massive Chinese monolingual data. Second, we continue training the model with a large-scale parallel dataset that covers 102 natural languages. Third, we instruct-tune the foundation model with multilingual translation instructions, leading to our BigTranslate model. The preliminary experiments on multilingual translation show that BigTranslate performs comparably with

Prometheus is a custom model along with 30 Hypernetworks I like to call Latent Later Cameras. These are virtual cameras that have been embedded in to the latent space which allow you to choose the camera angle and camera shot for your subject.  These cameras put you in to the directors seat so that you always get the shot you envisioned in your mind. Besides being very flexible, the latent cameras also tend to be very cohesive and produce very good results through natural language prompting.  That means there is no need for a word salad in your positive or negative prompts.  In fact you can use the Hypernetworks without any negative prompts at all and still get very good results. As long as you follow very basic rules outlined in the video guide, on average you will get very good results. Thank you!; Please note the Hypernetworks work with all models...that are based on the 1.5 architecture... sorry if I misled in the video. Sorry no 2.0 or 2.1 support.  ; Don't forget to enable your dynamic prompts by checking the enable box, otherwise you can load the Hypernetworks manually, just know that the strength of the Hypernetworks should be at 0.55 by default, otherwise you will not get good results.

this repository. This model is trained on uppercase amino acids: it only works with capital letter amino acids.; ProtBert-BFD is based on Bert model which pretrained on a large corpus of protein sequences in a self-supervised fashion.
This means it was pretrained on the raw protein sequences only, with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of
publicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those protein sequences.; One important difference between our Bert model and the original Bert version is the way of dealing with sequences as separate documents

The masking follows the original Bert training with randomly masks 15% of the amino acids in the input. ; At the end, the feature extracted from this model revealed that the LM-embeddings from unlabeled data (only protein sequences) captured important biophysical properties governing protein
shape.
This implied learning some of the grammar of the language of life realized in protein sequences.; The model could be used for protein feature extraction or to be fine-tuned on downstream tasks.

One use case of these models consist on fast perplexity estimation for filtering or sampling large datasets. For example, one could use a KenLM model trained on French Wikipedia to run inference on a large dataset and filter out samples that are very unlike to appear on Wikipedia (high perplexity), or very simple non-informative sentences that could appear repeatedly (low perplexity).; At the root of this repo you will find different directories named after the dataset models were trained on (e.g. wikipedia, oscar). Within each directory, you will find several models trained on different language subsets of the dataset (e.g. en (English), es (Spanish), fr (French)). For each language you will find three different files; The models have been trained using some of the preprocessing steps from cc_net, in particular replacing numbers with zeros and normalizing punctuation. So, it is important to keep the default values for the parameters: lower_case, remove_accents, normalize_numbers and punctuation when using the pre-trained models in order to replicate the same pre-processing steps at inference time.; In the example above we see that, since Wikipedia is a collection of encyclopedic articles, a KenLM model trained on it will naturally give lower perplexity scores to sentences with formal language and no grammar mistakes than colloquial sentences with grammar mistakes.; Unable to determine this model’s pipeline type.

It was introduced in the paper Densely Residual Laplacian Super-resolution by Anwar et al. (2020) and first released in this repository. ; The goal of image super resolution is to restore a high resolution (HR) image from a single low resolution (LR) image. The image below shows the ground truth (HR), the bicubic upscaling and model upscaling.; ; Super-Resolution convolutional neural networks have recently demonstrated high-quality restoration for single images. However, existing algorithms often require very deep architectures and long training times. Furthermore, current convolutional neural networks for super-resolution are unable to exploit features at multiple scales and weigh them equally, limiting their learning capability. In this exposition, we present a compact and accurate super-resolution algorithm namely, Densely Residual Laplacian Network (DRLN). The proposed network employs cascading residual on the residual structure to allow the flow of low-frequency information to focus on learning high and mid-level features. In addition, deep supervision is achieved via the densely concatenated residual blocks settings, which also helps in learning from high-level complex features. Moreover, we propose Laplacian attention to model the crucial features to learn the inter and intra-level dependencies between the feature maps. Furthermore, comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on low-resolution, noisy low-resolution, and real historical image benchmark datasets illustrate that our DRLN algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods visually and accurately.; You can use the pre-trained models for upscaling your images 2x, 3x and 4x.

For COCO, the number of object queries is set to 100. ; The model is trained using a ""bipartite matching loss"": one compares the predicted classes + bounding boxes of each of the N = 100 object queries to the ground truth annotations, padded up to the same length N (so if an image only contains 4 objects, 96 annotations will just have a ""no object"" as class and ""no bounding box"" as bounding box). The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to create an optimal one-to-one mapping between each of the N queries and each of the N annotations.

This paper presents XLSR which learns cross-lingual speech representations by pretraining a single model from the raw waveform of speech in multiple languages. We build on wav2vec 2.0 which is trained by solving a contrastive task over masked latent speech representations and jointly learns a quantization of the latents shared across languages. The resulting model is fine-tuned on labeled data and experiments show that cross-lingual pretraining significantly outperforms monolingual pretraining. On the CommonVoice benchmark, XLSR shows a relative phoneme error rate reduction of 72% compared to the best known results. On BABEL, our approach improves word error rate by 16% relative compared to a comparable system. Our approach enables a single multilingual speech recognition model which is competitive to strong individual models. Analysis shows that the latent discrete speech representations are shared across languages with increased sharing for related languages. We hope to catalyze research in low-resource speech understanding by releasing XLSR-53, a large model pretrained in 53 languages.",

HF Contribution: Harveen Singh Chadha
Dataset: LOL Dataset; Zero-Reference Deep Curve Estimation or Zero-DCE formulates low-light image enhancement as the task of estimating an image-specific tonal curve with a deep neural network. In this example, we train a lightweight deep network, DCE-Net, to estimate pixel-wise and high-order tonal curves for dynamic range adjustment of a given image.; Zero-DCE takes a low-light image as input and produces high-order tonal curves as its output. These curves are then used for pixel-wise adjustment on the dynamic range of the input to obtain an enhanced image. The curve estimation process is done in such a way that it maintains the range of the enhanced image and preserves the contrast of neighboring pixels. This curve estimation is inspired by curves adjustment used in photo editing software such as Adobe Photoshop where users can adjust points throughout an image’s tonal range.; Zero-DCE is appealing because of its relaxed assumptions with regard to reference images: it does not require any input/output image pairs during training. This is achieved through a set of carefully formulated non-reference loss functions, which implicitly measure the enhancement quality and guide the training of the network.; Sample Images:",Computer Vision

It was introduced in the paper BEIT: BERT Pre-Training of Image Transformers by Hangbo Bao, Li Dong and Furu Wei and first released in this repository. ; Disclaimer: The team releasing BEiT did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.; The BEiT model is a Vision Transformer (ViT), which is a transformer encoder model (BERT-like). In contrast to the original ViT model, BEiT is pretrained on a large collection of images in a self-supervised fashion, namely ImageNet-21k, at a resolution of 224x224 pixels. The pre-training objective for the model is to predict visual tokens from the encoder of OpenAI's DALL-E's VQ-VAE, based on masked patches.
Next, the model was fine-tuned in a supervised fashion on ImageNet (also referred to as ILSVRC2012), a dataset comprising 1 million images and 1,000 classes, also at resolution 224x224.; Images are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. Contrary to the original ViT models, BEiT models do use relative position embeddings (similar to T5) instead of absolute position embeddings, and perform classification of images by mean-pooling the final hidden states of the patches, instead of placing a linear layer on top of the final hidden state of the [CLS] token.; By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of images that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled images for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire image. Alternatively, one can mean-pool the final hidden states of the patch embeddings, and place a linear layer on top of that.",Computer Vision

The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts every language problem into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled datasets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new “Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus”, we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more.

The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to create an optimal one-to-one mapping between each of the N queries and each of the N annotations. Next, standard cross-entropy (for the classes) and a linear combination of the L1 and generalized IoU loss (for the bounding boxes) are used to optimize the parameters of the model.; ",Computer Vision

Standard classification approaches suffer from the annotation bottleneck and cannot effectively handle unseen entities. Zero-shot entity linking has emerged as a promising direction for generalizing to new entities, but it still requires example gold entity mentions during training and canonical descriptions for all entities, both of which are rarely available outside of Wikipedia (Logeswaran et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020). We explore Knowledge-RIch Self-Supervision (KRISS) and train a contextual encoder (KRISSBERT) for entity linking, by leveraging readily available unlabeled text and domain knowledge.; Specifically, the KRISSBERT model is initialized with PubMedBERT parameters, and then continuously pretrained using biomedical entity names from the UMLS ontology to self-supervise entity linking examples from PubMed abstracts. Experiments on seven standard biomedical entity linking datasets show that KRISSBERT attains new state of the art, outperforming prior self-supervised methods by as much as 20 absolute points in accuracy.
See Zhang et al., 2021 for the details.; Note that some prior systems like BioSyn, SapBERT, and their follow-up work (e.g., Lai et al., 2021) claimed to do entity linking, but their systems completely ignore the context of an entity mention, and can only predict a surface form in the entity dictionary (See Figure 1 in BioSyn), not the canonical entity ID (e.g., CUI in UMLS). Therefore, they can't disambiguate ambiguous mentions. For instance, given the entity mention ""ER"" in the sentence ""ER crowding has become a wide-spread problem"", their systems ignore the sentence context, and simply predict the closest surface form, which is just ""ER"". Multiple entities share this surface form as a potential name or alias, such as Emergency Room (C0562508), Estrogen Receptor Gene (C1414461), and Endoplasmic Reticulum(C0014239). Without using the context information, their systems can't resolve such ambiguity and pinpoint the correct entity Emergency Room (C0562508). More problematically, their evaluation would deem such an ambiguous prediction as correct. Consequently, the reported results in their papers do not reflect true performance on entity linking.; Here, we use the MedMentions data to show you how to 1) generate prototype embeddings, and 2) run entity linking.",Multimodel
