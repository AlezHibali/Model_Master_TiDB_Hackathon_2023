We release a smaller 3B variant of the LongLLaMA model on a permissive license (Apache 2.0) and inference code supporting longer contexts on Hugging Face. Our model weights can serve as the drop-in replacement of LLaMA in existing implementations (for short context up to 2048 tokens). Additionally, we provide evaluation results and comparisons against the original OpenLLaMA models. Stay tuned for further updates.; Focused Transformer: Contrastive Training for Context Scaling (FoT) presents a simple method for endowing language models with the ability to handle context consisting possibly of millions of tokens while training on significantly shorter input. FoT permits a subset of attention layers to access a memory cache of (key, value) pairs to extend the context length. The distinctive aspect of FoT is its training procedure, drawing from contrastive learning. Specifically, we deliberately expose the memory attention layers to both relevant and irrelevant keys (like negative samples from unrelated documents). This strategy incentivizes the model to differentiate keys connected with semantically diverse values, thereby enhancing their structure. This, in turn, makes it possible to extrapolate the effective context length much beyond what is seen in training. "

The method works by posing the sequence to be classified as the NLI premise and to construct a hypothesis from each candidate label. For example, if we want to evaluate whether a sequence belongs to the class ""politics"", we could construct a hypothesis of This text is about politics.. The probabilities for entailment and contradiction are then converted to label probabilities.; This method is surprisingly effective in many cases, particularly when used with larger pre-trained models like BART and Roberta. See this blog post for a more expansive introduction to this and other zero shot methods, and see the code snippets below for examples of using this model for zero-shot classification both with Hugging Face's built-in pipeline and with native Transformers/PyTorch code.; The model can be loaded with the zero-shot-classification pipeline like so:"

StarChat-¦Â is the second model in the series, and is a fine-tuned version of StarCoderPlus that was trained on an ""uncensored"" variant of the openassistant-guanaco dataset. We found that removing the in-built alignment of the OpenAssistant dataset boosted performance on the Open LLM Leaderboard and made the model more helpful at coding tasks. However, this means that model is likely to generate problematic text when prompted to do so and should only be used for educational and research purposes.; The model was fine-tuned on a variant of the OpenAssistant/oasst1 dataset, which contains a diverse range of dialogues in over 35 languages.

Models trained primarily on code data will also have a more skewed demographic bias commensurate with the demographics of the GitHub community, for more on this see the StarCoder dataset which is derived from The Stack.; Since the base model was pretrained on a large corpus of code, it may produce code snippets that are syntactically valid but semantically incorrect.

The Stable Diffusion 2.1 version is marginally more effective, as it was developed to address my specific needs. However, this 1.5 version model was also trained on the same dataset for those who are using the older version.; These models perform quite well in most cases, but please note that they are not 100% accurate. In some instances, the QR code shape might not come through as expected. You can increase the ControlNet weight to emphasize the QR code shape. However, be cautious as this might negatively impact the style of your output.To optimize for scanning, please generate your QR codes with correction mode 'H' (30%).; To balance between style and shape, a gentle fine-tuning of the control weight might be required based on the individual input and the desired output, aswell as the correct prompt. Some prompts do not work until you increase the weight by a lot. The process of finding the right balance between these factors is part art and part science. For the best results, it is recommended to generate your artwork at a resolution of 768. This allows for a higher level of detail in the final product, enhancing the quality and effectiveness of the QR code-based artwork.; The simplest way to use this is to place the .safetensors model and its .yaml config file in the folder where your other controlnet models are installed, which varies per application. 
For usage in auto1111 they can be placed in the webui/models/ControlNet folder. They can be loaded using the controlnet webui extension which you can install through the extensions tab in the webui (https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet). Make sure to enable your controlnet unit and set your input image as the QR code. Set the model to either the SD2.1 or 1.5 version depending on your base stable diffusion model, or it will error. No pre-processor is needed, though you can use the invert pre-processor for a different variation of results. 768 is the preferred resolution for generation since it allows for more detail.
Make sure to look up additional info on how to use controlnet if you get stuck, once you have the webui up and running its really easy to install the controlnet extension aswell."

Consequently, we present PolyLM, a multilingual LLM trained on 640 billion (B) tokens, avaliable in two model sizes: 1.7B and 13B. To enhance its multilingual capabilities, we 1) integrate bilingual data into training data; and 2) adopt a curriculum learning strategy that increases the proportion of non-English data from 30% in the first stage to 60% in the final stage during pre-training. Further, we propose a multilingual self-instruct method which automatically generates 132.7K  diverse multilingual instructions for model fine-tuning. To assess the model's performance, we collect several existing multilingual tasks, including multilingual understanding, question answering, generation, and translation. Extensive experiments show that PolyLM surpasses other open-source models such as LLaMA and BLOOM on multilingual tasks while maintaining comparable performance in English.; Find below some example scripts on how to use the model in transformers:; The primary use is research on language models, including: research on zero-shot NLP tasks and in-context few-shot learning NLP tasks, such as reasoning, and question answering; advancing fairness and safety research, and understanding limitations of current large language models; See the research paper for further details.; More information needed."

This is in contrast with the commonly employed strategy where a very large number of training examples (tens of thousands to even millions) of widely varying quality are used.; For LIMARP a similar approach was used, with the difference that the conversational data is almost entirely human-generated.

However, most existing pre-trained models only excel in either understanding-based tasks or generation-based tasks. Furthermore, performance improvement has been largely achieved by scaling up the dataset with noisy image-text pairs collected from the web, which is a suboptimal source of supervision. In this paper, we propose BLIP, a new VLP framework which transfers flexibly to both vision-language understanding and generation tasks. BLIP effectively utilizes the noisy web data by bootstrapping the captions, where a captioner generates synthetic captions and a filter removes the noisy ones. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of vision-language tasks, such as image-text retrieval (+2.7% in average recall@1), image captioning (+2.8% in CIDEr), and VQA (+1.6% in VQA score). BLIP also demonstrates strong generalization ability when directly transferred to videolanguage tasks in a zero-shot manner.

However, be cautious as this might negatively impact the style of your output.To optimize for scanning, please generate your QR codes with correction mode 'H' (30%).; To balance between style and shape, a gentle fine-tuning of the control weight might be required based on the individual input and the desired output, aswell as the correct prompt. Some prompts do not work until you increase the weight by a lot. The process of finding the right balance between these factors is part art and part science. For the best results, it is recommended to generate your artwork at a resolution of 768. This allows for a higher level of detail in the final product, enhancing the quality and effectiveness of the QR code-based artwork."

One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds absolute position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder.; By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of images that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled images for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder.

For example, given the prompt ""Translate to English: Je t¡¯aime."", the model will most likely answer ""I love you."". Some prompt ideas from our paper: ; Feel free to share your generations in the Community tab!; Prompt Engineering: The performance may vary depending on the prompt. For BLOOMZ models, we recommend making it very clear when the input stops to avoid the model trying to continue it. For example, the prompt ""Translate to English: Je t'aime"" without the full stop (.) at the end, may result in the model trying to continue the French sentence. Better prompts are e.g. ""Translate to English: Je t'aime."", ""Translate to English: Je t'aime. Translation:"" ""What is ""Je t'aime."" in English?"", where it is clear for the model when it should answer. Further, we recommend providing the model as much context as possible. For example, if you want it to answer in Telugu, then tell the model, e.g. ""Explain in a sentence in Telugu what is backpropagation in neural networks.""."

It was
introduced in this paper. The code for the distillation process can be found
here. This model is uncased: it does
not make a difference between english and English.; DistilBERT is a transformers model, smaller and faster than BERT, which was pretrained on the same corpus in a
self-supervised fashion, using the BERT base model as a teacher. This means it was pretrained on the raw texts only,
with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of publicly available data) with an automatic
process to generate inputs and labels from those texts using the BERT base model. More precisely, it was pretrained
with three objectives:; This way, the model learns the same inner representation of the English language than its teacher model, while being
faster for inference or downstream tasks.; You can use the raw model for either masked language modeling or next sentence prediction, but it's mostly intended to
be fine-tuned on a downstream task. See the model hub to look for
fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.; Note that this model is primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on tasks that use the whole sentence (potentially masked)
to make decisions, such as sequence classification, token classification or question answering. For tasks such as text
generation you should look at model like GPT2."

Additionally, we performed human evaluation with the XSTS protocol and measured the toxicity of the generated translations.; ? We used parallel multilingual data from a variety of sources to train the model. We provide detailed report on data selection and construction process in Section 5 in the paper. We also used monolingual data constructed from Common Crawl. We provide more details in Section 5.2.; ? In this work, we took a reflexive approach in technological development to ensure that we prioritize human users and minimize risks that could be transferred to them. While we reflect on our ethical considerations throughout the article, here are some additional points to highlight. For one, many languages chosen for this study are low-resource languages, with a heavy emphasis on African languages. While quality translation could improve education and information access in many in these communities, such an access could also make groups with lower levels of digital literacy more vulnerable to misinformation or online scams. The latter scenarios could arise if bad actors misappropriate our work for nefarious activities, which we conceive as an example of unintended use. Regarding data acquisition, the training data used for model development were mined from various publicly available sources on the web. Although we invested heavily in data cleaning, personally identifiable information may not be entirely eliminated. Finally, although we did our best to optimize for translation quality, mistranslations produced by the model could remain. Although the odds are low, this could have adverse impact on those who rely on these translations to make important decisions (particularly when related to health and safety)."

The license used is MIT.; Motivated by the success of T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) in pre-trained natural language processing models, we propose a unified-modal SpeechT5 framework that explores the encoder-decoder pre-training for self-supervised speech/text representation learning. The SpeechT5 framework consists of a shared encoder-decoder network and six modal-specific (speech/text) pre/post-nets. After preprocessing the input speech/text through the pre-nets, the shared encoder-decoder network models the sequence-to-sequence transformation, and then the post-nets generate the output in the speech/text modality based on the output of the decoder.; Leveraging large-scale unlabeled speech and text data, we pre-train SpeechT5 to learn a unified-modal representation, hoping to improve the modeling capability for both speech and text. To align the textual and speech information into this unified semantic space, we propose a cross-modal vector quantization approach that randomly mixes up speech/text states with latent units as the interface between encoder and decoder."

can use lots of publicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. More precisely, it
was pretrained with two objectives:; This way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language used in tables and associated texts, which can then be used 
to extract features useful for downstream tasks such as answering questions about a table, or determining whether a sentence is entailed

We excluded cells with high mutational burdens (e.g. malignant cells and immortalized cell lines) that could lead to substantial network rewiring without companion genome sequencing to facilitate interpretation. Each single cell¡¯s transcriptome is presented to the model as a rank value encoding where genes are ranked by their expression in that cell normalized by their expression across the entire Genecorpus-30M. The rank value encoding provides a nonparametric representation of that cell¡¯s transcriptome and takes advantage of the many observations of each gene¡¯s expression across Genecorpus-30M to prioritize genes that distinguish cell state. Specifically, this method will deprioritize ubiquitously highly-expressed housekeeping genes by normalizing them to a lower rank. Conversely, genes such as transcription factors that may be lowly expressed when they are expressed but highly distinguish cell state will move to a higher rank within the encoding. Furthermore, this rank-based approach may be more robust against technical artifacts that may systematically bias the absolute transcript counts value while the overall relative ranking of genes within each cell remains more stable. ; The rank value encoding of each single cell¡¯s transcriptome then proceeds through six transformer encoder units. Pretraining was accomplished using a masked learning objective where 15% of the genes within each transcriptome were masked and the model was trained to predict which gene should be within each masked position in that specific cell state using the context of the remaining unmasked genes. A major strength of this approach is that it is entirely self-supervised and can be accomplished on completely unlabeled data, which allows the inclusion of large amounts of training data without being restricted to samples with accompanying labels.; We detail applications and results in our manuscript.

with an encoder-decoder architecture that can flexibly operate in different modes (i.e. encoder-only, decoder-only,
and encoder-decoder) to support a wide range of code understanding and generation tasks.
It is introduced in the paper:; CodeT5+: Open Code Large Language Models for Code Understanding and Generation
by Yue Wang*, Hung Le*, Akhilesh Deepak Gotmare, Nghi D.Q. Bui, Junnan Li, Steven C.H. Hoi (*
indicates equal contribution).; Compared to the original CodeT5 family (base: 220M, large: 770M), CodeT5+ is pretrained with a diverse set of
pretraining tasks including span denoising, causal language modeling, contrastive learning, and text-code
matching to learn rich representations from both unimodal code data and bimodal code-text data.
Additionally, it employs a simple yet effective compute-efficient pretraining method to initialize the model
components with frozen off-the-shelf LLMs such as CodeGen to efficiently scale
up the model (i.e. 2B, 6B, 16B), and adopts a ""shallow encoder and deep decoder"" architecture.
Furthermore, it is instruction-tuned to align with natural language instructions (see our InstructCodeT5+ 16B)
following Code Alpaca.; This checkpoint consists of an encoder of CodeT5+ 220M model (pretrained from 2 stages on both unimodal and bimodal) and a projection layer, which can be used to extract code
embeddings of 256 dimension. It can be easily loaded using the AutoModel functionality and employs the
same CodeT5 tokenizer.; This checkpoint is trained on the stricter permissive subset of the deduplicated version of
the github-code dataset.
The data is preprocessed by reserving only permissively licensed code (""mit"" ¡°apache-2¡±, ¡°bsd-3-clause¡±, ¡°bsd-2-clause¡±,

geographic and climate-related tasks.; Trained on an original dataset of 1.1 million street-level urban and rural geo-tagged images, it achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple open-domain image geolocalization benchmarks in zero-shot, 
outperforming supervised models trained on millions of images.; StreetCLIP is a model pretrained by deriving image captions synthetically from image class labels using
a domain-specific caption template. This allows StreetCLIP to transfer its generalized zero-shot learning
capabilities to a specific domain (i.e. the domain of image geolocalization). 
StreetCLIP builds on the OpenAI's pretrained large version of CLIP ViT, using 14x14 pixel
patches and images with a 336 pixel side length.; StreetCLIP has a deep understanding of the visual features found in street-level urban and rural scenes
and knows how to relate these concepts to specific countries, regions, and cities. Given its training setup,
the following use cases are recommended for StreetCLIP.; StreetCLIP can be used out-of-the box using zero-shot learning to infer the geolocation of images on a country, region,
or city level. Given that StreetCLIP was pretrained on a dataset of street-level urban and rural images,
the best performance can be expected on images from a similar distribution."

Instead of fine-tuning on one direction, a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on many directions simultaneously. mBART-50 is created using the original mBART model and extended to add extra 25 languages to support multilingual machine translation models of 50 languages. The pre-training objective is explained below.; Multilingual Denoising Pretraining: The model incorporates N languages by concatenating data: 
D = {D1, ..., DN } where each Di is a collection of monolingual documents in language i. The source documents are noised using two schemes, 
first randomly shuffling the original sentences' order, and second a novel in-filling scheme, 
where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. The model is then tasked to reconstruct the original text. 
35% of each instance's words are masked by random sampling a span length according to a Poisson distribution (¦Ë = 3.5).
The decoder input is the original text with one position offset. A language id symbol LID is used as the initial token to predict the sentence.; mbart-large-50 is pre-trained model and primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on translation tasks. It can also be fine-tuned on other multilingual sequence-to-sequence tasks.

It enables reliable binary sentiment analysis for various types of English-language text. For each instance, it predicts either positive (1) or negative (0) sentiment. The model was fine-tuned and evaluated on 15 data sets from diverse text sources to enhance generalization across different types of texts (reviews, tweets, etc.). Consequently, it outperforms models trained on only one type of text (e.g., movie reviews from the popular SST-2 benchmark) when used on new data as shown below. ; If you want to predict sentiment for your own data, we provide an example script via Google Colab. You can load your data to a Google Drive and run the script for free on a Colab GPU. Set-up only takes a few minutes. We suggest that you manually label a subset of your data to evaluate performance for your use case.

The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to create an optimal one-to-one mapping between each of the N queries and each of the N annotations. Next, standard cross-entropy (for the classes) and a linear combination of the L1 and generalized IoU loss (for the bounding boxes) are used to optimize the parameters of the model.; You can use the raw model for object detection.

In this paper, we propose BLIP, a new VLP framework which transfers flexibly to both vision-language understanding and generation tasks. BLIP effectively utilizes the noisy web data by bootstrapping the captions, where a captioner generates synthetic captions and a filter removes the noisy ones. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of vision-language tasks, such as image-text retrieval (+2.7% in average recall@1), image captioning (+2.8% in CIDEr), and VQA (+1.6% in VQA score).

forms. Perhaps due to this diversity, previous work has typically relied on domainspecific recipes with limited sharing of the underlying data, model architectures,
and objectives. We present Pix2Struct, a pretrained image-to-text model for
purely visual language understanding, which can be finetuned on tasks containing visually-situated language. Pix2Struct is pretrained by learning to parse
masked screenshots of web pages into simplified HTML. The web, with its richness of visual elements cleanly reflected in the HTML structure, provides a large
source of pretraining data well suited to the diversity of downstream tasks. Intuitively, this objective subsumes common pretraining signals such as OCR, language modeling, image captioning. In addition to the novel pretraining strategy,
we introduce a variable-resolution input representation and a more flexible integration of language and vision inputs, where language prompts such as questions
are rendered directly on top of the input image. For the first time, we show that a
single pretrained model can achieve state-of-the-art results in six out of nine tasks

Comprehending plots and charts requires strong reasoning skills. Prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) models require at least tens of thousands of training examples and their reasoning capabilities are still much limited, especially on complex human-written queries. This paper presents the first one-shot solution to visual language reasoning. We decompose the challenge of visual language reasoning into two steps: (1) plot-to-text translation, and (2) reasoning over the translated text. The key in this method is a modality conversion module, named as DePlot, which translates the image of a plot or chart to a linearized table. The output of DePlot can then be directly used to prompt a pretrained large language model (LLM), exploiting the few-shot reasoning capabilities of LLMs. To obtain DePlot, we standardize the plot-to-table task by establishing unified task formats and metrics, and train DePlot end-to-end on this task. DePlot can then be used off-the-shelf together with LLMs in a plug-and-play fashion. Compared with a SOTA model finetuned on more than >28k data points, DePlot+LLM with just one-shot prompting achieves a 24.0% improvement over finetuned SOTA on human-written queries from the task of chart QA.; You can run a prediction by querying an input image together with a question as follows:; You can use the convert_pix2struct_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py script as follows:"

Firstly, we used Anki flashcards to automatically generate questions, 
from the front of the cards and anwers from the back of the card. 
Secondly, we generated medical question-answer pairs from Wikidoc. 
We extracted paragraphs with relevant headings, and used Chat-GPT 3.5 
to generate questions from the headings and using the corresponding paragraphs 
as answers. This dataset is still under development and we believe 
that approximately 70% of these question answer pairs are factual correct. 
Thirdly, we used StackExchange to extract question-answer pairs, taking the 
top-rated question from five categories: Academia, Bioinformatics, Biology, 
Fitness, and Health. Additionally, we used a dataset from ChatDoctor 
consisting of 200,000 question-answer pairs, available at https://github.com/Kent0n-Li/ChatDoctor."

The Stable Diffusion 2.1 version is marginally more effective, as it was developed to address my specific needs. However, a 1.5 version model was also trained on the same dataset for those who are using the older version.; These models perform quite well in most cases, but please note that they are not 100% accurate. In some instances, the QR code shape might not come through as expected. You can increase the ControlNet weight to emphasize the QR code shape. However, be cautious as this might negatively impact the style of your output.To optimize for scanning, please generate your QR codes with correction mode 'H' (30%).; To balance between style and shape, a gentle fine-tuning of the control weight might be required based on the individual input and the desired output, aswell as the correct prompt. Some prompts do not work until you increase the weight by a lot. The process of finding the right balance between these factors is part art and part science. For the best results, it is recommended to generate your artwork at a resolution of 768. This allows for a higher level of detail in the final product, enhancing the quality and effectiveness of the QR code-based artwork.; The simplest way to use this is to place the .safetensors model and its .yaml config file in the folder where your other controlnet models are installed, which varies per application. 
For usage in auto1111 they can be placed in the webui/models/ControlNet folder. They can be loaded using the controlnet webui extension which you can install through the extensions tab in the webui (https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet). Make sure to enable your controlnet unit and set your input image as the QR code. Set the model to either the SD2.1 or 1.5 version depending on your base stable diffusion model, or it will error. No pre-processor is needed, though you can use the invert pre-processor for a different variation of results. 768 is the preferred resolution for generation since it allows for more detail.
Make sure to look up additional info on how to use controlnet if you get stuck, once you have the webui up and running its really easy to install the controlnet extension aswell."

Unlike recent work on 3D generative models which produce a single output representation, Shap-E directly generates the parameters of implicit functions that can be rendered as both textured meshes and neural radiance fields. We train Shap-E in two stages: first, we train an encoder that deterministically maps 3D assets into the parameters of an implicit function; second, we train a conditional diffusion model on outputs of the encoder. When trained on a large dataset of paired 3D and text data, our resulting models are capable of generating complex and diverse 3D assets in a matter of seconds. When compared to Point-E, an explicit generative model over point clouds, Shap-E converges faster and reaches comparable or better sample quality despite modeling a higher-dimensional, multi-representation output space.

Currently, WizardCoder is one the most performant Code Generation models, being beaten only by ChatGPT. This takes the Code Alpaca 20k dataset and evolves each instruction through a randomly chosen evolution prompt to increase instruction complexity. These prompts range from increase time/space complexity, to increasing requirements, to adding erroneus code to improve robustness, etc. This is done three times with pruning and post processing to remove unwanted instructions and responses. The iterative addition of more complexity gives higher quality and more in-depth instructions than what is ususally generated in Alpaca methods. This, like in the case of WizardCoder and WizardLM, can lead to strong performance that gets very close to RLHF model performance.; This model uses ReplitLM fine tuned with the following parameters:"

The openassistant-guanaco dataset was further trimmed to within 2 standard deviations of token size for input and output pairs and all non-english data has been removed to reduce training size requirements.; Version 1.1 showcases notable enhancements, employing a modified version of the previous openassistant-guanaco dataset. This dataset underwent a comprehensive revision, replacing every single answer with those generated by GPT-4.; The volume of the datasets has also been augmented by approximately 50%, with a particular focus on high school and abstract algebra. This expansion leveraged the combined capabilities of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo. The initial evaluation of algebraic functions over 12 epochs indicated promising results from this enriched dataset. However, this is just the beginning; further refinements are in the pipeline, aiming to optimize the dataset quality and subsequently decrease the number of epochs required to achieve comparable results.; Considering the need to curtail memory consumption during training, this dataset was tailored to consist solely of English language questions and answers. Consequently, the model's performance in language translation may not be up to par. Nevertheless, the focus remains on enhancing the model's proficiency and efficiency within its defined scope.; This model is designed to be used for a wide array of text generation tasks that require understanding and generating English text. The model is expected to perform well in tasks such as answering questions, writing essays, summarizing text, translation, and more. However, given the specific data processing and finetuning done, it might be particularly effective for tasks related to English language question-answering systems."

It was introduced in the paper End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers by Carion et al. and first released in this repository. ; Disclaimer: The team releasing DETR did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.; The DETR model is an encoder-decoder transformer with a convolutional backbone. Two heads are added on top of the decoder outputs in order to perform object detection: a linear layer for the class labels and a MLP (multi-layer perceptron) for the bounding boxes. The model uses so-called object queries to detect objects in an image. Each object query looks for a particular object in the image. For COCO, the number of object queries is set to 100. ; The model is trained using a ""bipartite matching loss"": one compares the predicted classes + bounding boxes of each of the N = 100 object queries to the ground truth annotations, padded up to the same length N (so if an image only contains 4 objects, 96 annotations will just have a ""no object"" as class and ""no bounding box"" as bounding box). The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to create an optimal one-to-one mapping between each of the N queries and each of the N annotations. Next, standard cross-entropy (for the classes) and a linear combination of the L1 and generalized IoU loss (for the bounding boxes) are used to optimize the parameters of the model.; "

We test four definition generation methods for this new task, finding that a sequence-to-sequence approach is most successful. We then explore the version of the task in which definitions are generated at a target complexity level. We in- troduce a novel reranking approach and find in human evaluations that it offers superior fluency while also controlling complexity, compared to several controllable generation baselines.; The model is finetuned on the task of generating definitions of scientific terms. We frame our task as generating an answer to the question ¡°What is (are) X?¡± Along with the question, the model takes a support document of scientific abstracted related to the term being defined.

Content from this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.; To quote the first two paragraphs of the official paper; Large language models trained on massive text collections have shown surprising emergent
capabilities to generate text and perform zero- and few-shot learning. While in some cases the public
can interact with these models through paid APIs, full model access is currently limited to only a
few highly resourced labs. This restricted access has limited researchers¡¯ ability to study how and
why these large language models work, hindering progress on improving known challenges in areas
such as robustness, bias, and toxicity.; We present Open Pretrained Transformers (OPT), a suite of decoder-only pre-trained transformers ranging from 125M
to 175B parameters, which we aim to fully and responsibly share with interested researchers. We train the OPT models to roughly match 
the performance and sizes of the GPT-3 class of models, while also applying the latest best practices in data
collection and efficient training. Our aim in developing this suite of OPT models is to enable reproducible and responsible research at scale, and
to bring more voices to the table in studying the impact of these LLMs. Definitions of risk, harm, bias, and toxicity, etc., should be articulated by the
collective research community as a whole, which is only possible when models are available for study."

The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on each dataset. Surprisingly, it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on ANLI (ALBERT-XXL) by 8,3%.

In this work, we took a reflexive approach in technological development to ensure that we prioritize human users and minimize risks that could be transferred to them. While we reflect on our ethical considerations throughout the article, here are some additional points to highlight. For one, many languages chosen for this study are low-resource languages, with a heavy emphasis on African languages. While quality translation could improve education and information access in many in these communities, such an access could also make groups with lower levels of digital literacy more vulnerable to misinformation or online scams. The latter scenarios could arise if bad actors misappropriate our work for nefarious activities, which we conceive as an example of unintended use. Regarding data acquisition, the training data used for model development were mined from various publicly available sources on the web. Although we invested heavily in data cleaning, personally identifiable information may not be entirely eliminated. Finally, although we did our best to optimize for translation quality, mistranslations produced by the model could remain. Although the odds are low, this could have adverse impact on those who rely on these translations to make important decisions (particularly when related to health and safety)."

Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve a new state of the art for image inpainting and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, semantic scene synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs.; Authors; Robin Rombach, Andreas Blattmann, Dominik Lorenz, Patrick Esser, Bj?rn Ommer"

Our objective is to make scientific knowledge universally accessible. If you have already experimented with our baseline model (sas_baseline), you will find that the current model surpasses its predecessor in terms of all evaluation metrics. Feel free to test it via the Hosted Inference API to your right. Simply select one of the provided examples or input your own scientific abstract. Just ensure to precede your text with the instruction, ""summarize, simplify, and contextualize: "", followed by a space. For local usage, refer to the Usage section.""; Open science has significantly reduced barriers to accessing scientific papers.
However, attainable research does not entail accessible knowledge.
Consequently, many individuals might prefer to rely on succinct social media narratives rather than endeavour to comprehend a scientific paper.
This preference is understandable as humans often favor narratives over dry, technical information. 
So, why not ""translate"" these intricate scientific abstracts into simpler, more accessible narratives? 
Several prestigious journals have already initiated steps towards enhancing accessibility. 
For instance, PNAS requires authors to submit Significance Statements understandable to an 'undergraduate-educated scientist', while Science includes an editor's abstract to provide a swift overview of the paper's salient points.; In this project, our objective is to employ AI to rewrite scientific abstracts into easily understandable scientific narratives.
To facilitate this, we have curated two new datasets: one containing PNAS abstract-significance pairs and the other encapsulating editor abstracts from Science.
We utilize a Transformer model (a variant known as Flan-T5) to fine-tune our model for the task of simplifying scientific abstracts.
Initially, the model is fine-tuned utilizing multiple discrete instructions by amalgamating four pertinent tasks in a challenge-proportional manner (a strategy we refer to as Multi-Instruction Pretuning).
Subsequently, we continue the fine-tuning process exclusively with the abstract-significance corpus. Our model can generate lay summaries that outperform models fine-tuned solely with the abstract-significance corpus and models fine-tuned with traditional task combinations.
We hope our work can foster a more comprehensive understanding of scientific research, enabling a larger audience to benefit from open science.; Use the code below to get started with the model. Remember to prepend the INSTRUCTION for best performance.; We finetuned the base model (flan-t5-large) on multiple relevant tasks with standard language modeling loss. During training, the source text of each task is prepended with an task-specific instruction and mapped to the corresponding target text. For example, ""simplify: "" is added before a wiki text, and the whole text is fed into the model to line up with the corresponding simple wiki text. The tuning process has two steps."

BioGPT-Large,Text Generation,PyTorch; Transformers,English,mit,,109,pubmed,"5,709",6442.758577,22,https://huggingface.co/microsoft/BioGPT-Large,"Pre-trained language models have attracted increasing attention in the biomedical domain, inspired by their great success in the general natural language domain. Among the two main branches of pre-trained language models in the general language domain, i.e. BERT (and its variants) and GPT (and its variants), the first one has been extensively studied in the biomedical domain, such as BioBERT and PubMedBERT. While they have achieved great success on a variety of discriminative downstream biomedical tasks, the lack of generation ability constrains their application scope. In this paper, we propose BioGPT, a domain-specific generative Transformer language model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical literature. We evaluate BioGPT on six biomedical natural language processing tasks and demonstrate that our model outperforms previous models on most tasks. Especially, we get 44.98%, 38.42% and 40.76% F1 score on BC5CDR, KD-DTI and DDI end-to-end relation extraction tasks, respectively, and 78.2% accuracy on PubMedQA, creating a new record. Our case study on text generation further demonstrates the advantage of BioGPT on biomedical literature to generate fluent descriptions for biomedical terms.; If you find BioGPT useful in your research, please cite the following paper:"

e621.net, a rich resource of millions of hand-labeled artworks, each of which is both human-labeled topically and rated 
according to its quality.  E621.net allows users to express their approval of an artwork by either up-voting it, or marking it as a favorite.Boring_e621 was specifically trained on artworks automatically selected from the site according to the criteria 
that no user has ever Favorited or Up-Voted them.  boring_e621 thus learned to produce low-quality images, so when it is 
used in the negative prompt of a stable diffusion image generator, the model avoids making mistakes that would make the generation more boring.

forms. Perhaps due to this diversity, previous work has typically relied on domainspecific recipes with limited sharing of the underlying data, model architectures,
and objectives. We present Pix2Struct, a pretrained image-to-text model for
purely visual language understanding, which can be finetuned on tasks containing visually-situated language. Pix2Struct is pretrained by learning to parse
masked screenshots of web pages into simplified HTML. The web, with its richness of visual elements cleanly reflected in the HTML structure, provides a large
source of pretraining data well suited to the diversity of downstream tasks. Intuitively, this objective subsumes common pretraining signals such as OCR, language modeling, image captioning. In addition to the novel pretraining strategy,
we introduce a variable-resolution input representation and a more flexible integration of language and vision inputs, where language prompts such as questions
are rendered directly on top of the input image. For the first time, we show that a
single pretrained model can achieve state-of-the-art results in six out of nine tasks

It is based on LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) and contains 7 billion parameters. 
The primary goal of this model is to improve question-answering and medical dialogue tasks.
It was trained using LoRA and quantized, to reduce memory footprint. ; The training data for this project was sourced from various resources. 
Firstly, we used Anki flashcards to automatically generate questions, 
from the front of the cards and anwers from the back of the card. 
Secondly, we generated medical question-answer pairs from Wikidoc. 
We extracted paragraphs with relevant headings, and used Chat-GPT 3.5 
to generate questions from the headings and using the corresponding paragraphs 
as answers. This dataset is still under development and we believe 
that approximately 70% of these question answer pairs are factual correct. 
Thirdly, we used StackExchange to extract question-answer pairs, taking the 
top-rated question from five categories: Academia, Bioinformatics, Biology, 
Fitness, and Health. Additionally, we used a dataset from ChatDoctor 
consisting of 200,000 question-answer pairs, available at https://github.com/Kent0n-Li/ChatDoctor.; The model may not perform effectively outside the scope of the medical domain.
The training data primarily targets the knowledge level of medical students, 
which may result in limitations when addressing the needs of board-certified physicians.
The model has not been tested in real-world applications, so its efficacy and accuracy are currently unknown. 
It should never be used as a substitute for a doctor's opinion and must be treated as a research tool only."

The goal of this test was to explore the potential of the BLOOM architecture for language modeling tasks that require instruction-based responses.; To achieve this goal, we used a pre-trained LLM model with limited training, and fine-tuned it using a dataset of naive translations of instruction-based content. The dataset was created by taking instructions in English and translating them into German using an automated translation tool. While this approach may introduce errors in the translated content, we wanted to test whether the model could still learn to generate instruction-based responses in a variety of languages.; instruct-igel-001 is trained on naive translated instruction datasets, without much post-processing.

We propose MATCHA (Math reasoning and Chart derendering pretraining) to enhance visual language models¡¯ capabilities jointly modeling charts/plots and language data. Specifically we propose several pretraining tasks that cover plot deconstruction and numerical reasoning which are the key capabilities in visual language modeling. We perform the MATCHA pretraining starting from Pix2Struct, a recently proposed imageto-text visual language model. On standard benchmarks such as PlotQA and ChartQA, MATCHA model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by as much as nearly 20%. We also examine how well MATCHA pretraining transfers to domains such as screenshot, textbook diagrams, and document figures and observe overall improvement, verifying the usefulness of MATCHA pretraining on broader visual language tasks.; You should ask specific questions to the model in order to get consistent generations.

InstructUIE,Text2Text Generation,PyTorch; Transformers,,openrail,,3,,161,46154.93173,,https://huggingface.co/ZWK/InstructUIE,"https://github.com/BeyonderXX/InstructUIE; Large language models have unlocked strong multi-task capabilities from reading instructive prompts.
However, recent studies have shown that existing large models still have difficulty with information extraction tasks. 
For example, gpt-3.5-turbo achieved an F1 score of 18.22 on the Ontonotes dataset, which is significantly lower than the state-of-the-art performance.
In this paper, we propose InstructUIE, a unified information extraction framework based on instruction tuning, which can uniformly model various information extraction tasks and capture the inter-task dependency.
To validate the proposed method, we introduce IE INSTRUCTIONS, a benchmark of 32 diverse information extraction datasets in a unified text-to-text format with expert-written instructions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to Bert in supervised settings and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art and gpt3.5 in zero-shot settings.; Our models are trained and evaluated on IE INSTRUCTIONS.

However, many LLMs especially the open-sourced ones, such as BLOOM and LLaMA, are English-dominant and support only dozens of natural languages, making the potential of LLMs on language translation less explored. In this work, we present BigTranslate which adapts LLaMA that covers only 20 languages and enhances it with multilingual translation capability on more than 100 languages. BigTranslate is built upon LLaMA-13B and it is optimized in three steps. First, we continue training LLaMA with massive Chinese monolingual data. Second, we continue training the model with a large-scale parallel dataset that covers 102 natural languages. Third, we instruct-tune the foundation model with multilingual translation instructions, leading to our BigTranslate model. The preliminary experiments on multilingual translation show that BigTranslate performs comparably with 
ChatGPT and Google Translate in many languages and even outperforms ChatGPT in 8 language pairs. We release the BigTranslate model and hope it can advance the research progress.; More Details can be found at https://github.com/ZNLP/BigTranslate and https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18098"

Known as savants, followers of this tradition are a bookish lot who see beauty and mystery in the application of magic. The results of a spell are less interesting to them than the process that creates it. Some savants take a haughty attitude toward those who follow a tradition focused on a single school of magic, seeing them as provincial and lacking the sophistication needed to master true magic.

Prometheus is a custom model along with 30 Hypernetworks I like to call Latent Later Cameras. These are virtual cameras that have been embedded in to the latent space which allow you to choose the camera angle and camera shot for your subject.  These cameras put you in to the directors seat so that you always get the shot you envisioned in your mind. Besides being very flexible, the latent cameras also tend to be very cohesive and produce very good results through natural language prompting.  That means there is no need for a word salad in your positive or negative prompts.  In fact you can use the Hypernetworks without any negative prompts at all and still get very good results. As long as you follow very basic rules outlined in the video guide, on average you will get very good results. Thank you!; Please note the Hypernetworks work with all models...that are based on the 1.5 architecture... sorry if I misled in the video. Sorry no 2.0 or 2.1 support.  ; Don't forget to enable your dynamic prompts by checking the enable box, otherwise you can load the Hypernetworks manually, just know that the strength of the Hypernetworks should be at 0.55 by default, otherwise you will not get good results.

this paper and first released in
this repository. This model is trained on uppercase amino acids: it only works with capital letter amino acids.; ProtBert-BFD is based on Bert model which pretrained on a large corpus of protein sequences in a self-supervised fashion.
This means it was pretrained on the raw protein sequences only, with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of
publicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those protein sequences.; One important difference between our Bert model and the original Bert version is the way of dealing with sequences as separate documents
This means the Next sentence prediction is not used, as each sequence is treated as a complete document.
The masking follows the original Bert training with randomly masks 15% of the amino acids in the input. ; At the end, the feature extracted from this model revealed that the LM-embeddings from unlabeled data (only protein sequences) captured important biophysical properties governing protein
shape.
This implied learning some of the grammar of the language of life realized in protein sequences.; The model could be used for protein feature extraction or to be fine-tuned on downstream tasks.

It was introduced in the paper Densely Residual Laplacian Super-resolution by Anwar et al. (2020) and first released in this repository. ; The goal of image super resolution is to restore a high resolution (HR) image from a single low resolution (LR) image. The image below shows the ground truth (HR), the bicubic upscaling and model upscaling.; ; Super-Resolution convolutional neural networks have recently demonstrated high-quality restoration for single images. However, existing algorithms often require very deep architectures and long training times. Furthermore, current convolutional neural networks for super-resolution are unable to exploit features at multiple scales and weigh them equally, limiting their learning capability. In this exposition, we present a compact and accurate super-resolution algorithm namely, Densely Residual Laplacian Network (DRLN). The proposed network employs cascading residual on the residual structure to allow the flow of low-frequency information to focus on learning high and mid-level features. In addition, deep supervision is achieved via the densely concatenated residual blocks settings, which also helps in learning from high-level complex features. Moreover, we propose Laplacian attention to model the crucial features to learn the inter and intra-level dependencies between the feature maps. Furthermore, comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on low-resolution, noisy low-resolution, and real historical image benchmark datasets illustrate that our DRLN algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods visually and accurately.; You can use the pre-trained models for upscaling your images 2x, 3x and 4x.

We show that large scale models can learn these skills when given appropriate training data and choice of generation strategy. We build variants of these recipes with 90M, 2.7B and 9.4B parameter neural models, and make our models and code publicly available. Human evaluations show our best models are superior to existing approaches in multi-turn dialogue in terms of engagingness and humanness measurements. We then discuss the limitations of this work by analyzing failure cases of our models."

Two heads are added on top of the decoder outputs in order to perform object detection: a linear layer for the class labels and a MLP (multi-layer perceptron) for the bounding boxes. The model uses so-called object queries to detect objects in an image. Each object query looks for a particular object in the image. For COCO, the number of object queries is set to 100. ; The model is trained using a ""bipartite matching loss"": one compares the predicted classes + bounding boxes of each of the N = 100 object queries to the ground truth annotations, padded up to the same length N (so if an image only contains 4 objects, 96 annotations will just have a ""no object"" as class and ""no bounding box"" as bounding box). The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to create an optimal one-to-one mapping between each of the N queries and each of the N annotations. Next, standard cross-entropy (for the classes) and a linear combination of the L1 and generalized IoU loss (for the bounding boxes) are used to optimize the parameters of the model.; DETR can be naturally extended to perform panoptic segmentation, by adding a mask head on top of the decoder outputs."

This paper presents XLSR which learns cross-lingual speech representations by pretraining a single model from the raw waveform of speech in multiple languages. We build on wav2vec 2.0 which is trained by solving a contrastive task over masked latent speech representations and jointly learns a quantization of the latents shared across languages. The resulting model is fine-tuned on labeled data and experiments show that cross-lingual pretraining significantly outperforms monolingual pretraining. On the CommonVoice benchmark, XLSR shows a relative phoneme error rate reduction of 72% compared to the best known results. On BABEL, our approach improves word error rate by 16% relative compared to a comparable system. Our approach enables a single multilingual speech recognition model which is competitive to strong individual models. Analysis shows that the latent discrete speech representations are shared across languages with increased sharing for related languages. We hope to catalyze research in low-resource speech understanding by releasing XLSR-53, a large model pretrained in 53 languages."

HF Contribution: Harveen Singh Chadha
Dataset: LOL Dataset; Zero-Reference Deep Curve Estimation or Zero-DCE formulates low-light image enhancement as the task of estimating an image-specific tonal curve with a deep neural network. In this example, we train a lightweight deep network, DCE-Net, to estimate pixel-wise and high-order tonal curves for dynamic range adjustment of a given image.; Zero-DCE takes a low-light image as input and produces high-order tonal curves as its output. These curves are then used for pixel-wise adjustment on the dynamic range of the input to obtain an enhanced image. The curve estimation process is done in such a way that it maintains the range of the enhanced image and preserves the contrast of neighboring pixels. This curve estimation is inspired by curves adjustment used in photo editing software such as Adobe Photoshop where users can adjust points throughout an image¡¯s tonal range.; Zero-DCE is appealing because of its relaxed assumptions with regard to reference images: it does not require any input/output image pairs during training. This is achieved through a set of carefully formulated non-reference loss functions, which implicitly measure the enhancement quality and guide the training of the network.; Sample Images:"

It was introduced in the paper BEIT: BERT Pre-Training of Image Transformers by Hangbo Bao, Li Dong and Furu Wei and first released in this repository. ; Disclaimer: The team releasing BEiT did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.; The BEiT model is a Vision Transformer (ViT), which is a transformer encoder model (BERT-like). In contrast to the original ViT model, BEiT is pretrained on a large collection of images in a self-supervised fashion, namely ImageNet-21k, at a resolution of 224x224 pixels. The pre-training objective for the model is to predict visual tokens from the encoder of OpenAI's DALL-E's VQ-VAE, based on masked patches.
Next, the model was fine-tuned in a supervised fashion on ImageNet (also referred to as ILSVRC2012), a dataset comprising 1 million images and 1,000 classes, also at resolution 224x224.; Images are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. Contrary to the original ViT models, BEiT models do use relative position embeddings (similar to T5) instead of absolute position embeddings, and perform classification of images by mean-pooling the final hidden states of the patches, instead of placing a linear layer on top of the final hidden state of the [CLS] token.; By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of images that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled images for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire image. Alternatively, one can mean-pool the final hidden states of the patch embeddings, and place a linear layer on top of that."

Standard classification approaches suffer from the annotation bottleneck and cannot effectively handle unseen entities. Zero-shot entity linking has emerged as a promising direction for generalizing to new entities, but it still requires example gold entity mentions during training and canonical descriptions for all entities, both of which are rarely available outside of Wikipedia (Logeswaran et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020). We explore Knowledge-RIch Self-Supervision (KRISS) and train a contextual encoder (KRISSBERT) for entity linking, by leveraging readily available unlabeled text and domain knowledge.; Specifically, the KRISSBERT model is initialized with PubMedBERT parameters, and then continuously pretrained using biomedical entity names from the UMLS ontology to self-supervise entity linking examples from PubMed abstracts. Experiments on seven standard biomedical entity linking datasets show that KRISSBERT attains new state of the art, outperforming prior self-supervised methods by as much as 20 absolute points in accuracy.
See Zhang et al., 2021 for the details.; Note that some prior systems like BioSyn, SapBERT, and their follow-up work (e.g., Lai et al., 2021) claimed to do entity linking, but their systems completely ignore the context of an entity mention, and can only predict a surface form in the entity dictionary (See Figure 1 in BioSyn), not the canonical entity ID (e.g., CUI in UMLS). Therefore, they can't disambiguate ambiguous mentions. For instance, given the entity mention ""ER"" in the sentence ""ER crowding has become a wide-spread problem"", their systems ignore the sentence context, and simply predict the closest surface form, which is just ""ER"". Multiple entities share this surface form as a potential name or alias, such as Emergency Room (C0562508), Estrogen Receptor Gene (C1414461), and Endoplasmic Reticulum(C0014239). Without using the context information, their systems can't resolve such ambiguity and pinpoint the correct entity Emergency Room (C0562508). More problematically, their evaluation would deem such an ambiguous prediction as correct. Consequently, the reported results in their papers do not reflect true performance on entity linking.; Here, we use the MedMentions data to show you how to 1) generate prototype embeddings, and 2) run entity linking."

However, each Medium article can have at most five tags, therefore the author needs to choose what he/she believes are the best tags (mainly for SEO-related purposes).

UL2 uses Mixture-of-Denoisers (MoD), apre-training objective that combines diverse pre-training paradigms together. UL2 introduces a notion of mode switching, wherein downstream fine-tuning is associated with specific pre-training schemes.; ; Abstract; Existing pre-trained models are generally geared towards a particular class of problems. To date, there seems to be still no consensus on what the right architecture and pre-training setup should be. This paper presents a unified framework for pre-training models that are universally effective across datasets and setups. We begin by disentangling architectural archetypes with pre-training objectives -- two concepts that are commonly conflated. Next, we present a generalized and unified perspective for self-supervision in NLP and show how different pre-training objectives can be cast as one another and how interpolating between different objectives can be effective. We then propose Mixture-of-Denoisers (MoD), a pre-training objective that combines diverse pre-training paradigms together. We furthermore introduce a notion of mode switching, wherein downstream fine-tuning is associated with specific pre-training schemes. We conduct extensive ablative experiments to compare multiple pre-training objectives and find that our method pushes the Pareto-frontier by outperforming T5 and/or GPT-like models across multiple diverse setups. Finally, by scaling our model up to 20B parameters, we achieve SOTA performance on 50 well-established supervised NLP tasks ranging from language generation (with automated and human evaluation), language understanding, text classification, question answering, commonsense reasoning, long text reasoning, structured knowledge grounding and information retrieval. Our model also achieve strong results at in-context learning, outperforming 175B GPT-3 on zero-shot SuperGLUE and tripling the performance of T5-XXL on one-shot summarization. ; For more information, please take a look at the original paper."

OWL-ViT is a zero-shot text-conditioned object detection model that can be used to query an image with one or multiple text queries.  ; OWL-ViT uses CLIP as its multi-modal backbone, with a ViT-like Transformer to get visual features and a causal language model to get the text features. To use CLIP for detection, OWL-ViT removes the final token pooling layer of the vision model and attaches a lightweight classification and box head to each transformer output token. Open-vocabulary classification is enabled by replacing the fixed classification layer weights with the class-name embeddings obtained from the text model. The authors first train CLIP from scratch and fine-tune it end-to-end with the classification and box heads on standard detection datasets using a bipartite matching loss. One or multiple text queries per image can be used to perform zero-shot text-conditioned object detection. ; May 2022; The model uses a CLIP backbone with a ViT-L/14 Transformer architecture as an image encoder and uses a masked self-attention Transformer as a text encoder. These encoders are trained to maximize the similarity of (image, text) pairs via a contrastive loss. The CLIP backbone is trained from scratch and fine-tuned together with the box and class prediction heads with an object detection objective.; The model is intended as a research output for research communities. We hope that this model will enable researchers to better understand and explore zero-shot, text-conditioned object detection. We also hope it can be used for interdisciplinary studies of the potential impact of such models, especially in areas that commonly require identifying objects whose label is unavailable during training."

The model is inspired by the CLIP approach, introduced by Alec Radford et al. The idea is to train a vision encoder and a text encoder jointly to project the representation of images and their captions into the same embedding space, such that the caption embeddings are located near the embeddings of the images they describe.; The MS-COCO dataset was used to train the dual encoder model. MS-COCO contains over 82,000 images, each of which has at least 5 different caption annotations.

One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder.; By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of videos that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled videos for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire video."

It employs a simple bottleneck architecture that learns to compress the passage information into a dense vector through self-supervised pre-training. 
We use a replaced language modeling objective, which is inspired by ELECTRA, 
to improve the sample efficiency and reduce the mismatch of the input distribution between pre-training and fine-tuning. 
SimLM only requires access to unlabeled corpus, and is more broadly applicable when there are no labeled data or queries. 
We conduct experiments on several large-scale passage retrieval datasets, and show substantial improvements over strong baselines under various settings. 
Remarkably, SimLM even outperforms multi-vector approaches such as ColBERTv2 which incurs significantly more storage cost.; Since we use a listwise loss to train the re-ranker,
the relevance score is not bounded to a specific numerical range.
Higher scores mean more relevant between the given query and passage.; Get relevance score from our re-ranker:"

While language models are widely used for tasks other than this, there are a lot of unknowns with this work especially in the design context. Architext will often generate a design that is not semantically correct, depending on the prompt description it was given, although it almost always generates designs that are valid (non intersecting spaces, no orphan rooms).

It was introduced in the paper Conditional DETR for Fast Training Convergence by Meng et al. and first released in this repository. ; The recently-developed DETR approach applies the transformer encoder and decoder architecture to object detection and achieves promising performance. In this paper, we handle the critical issue, slow training convergence, and present a conditional cross-attention mechanism for fast DETR training. Our approach is motivated by that the cross-attention in DETR relies highly on the content embeddings for localizing the four extremities and predicting the box, which increases the need for high-quality content embeddings and thus the training difficulty. Our approach, named conditional DETR, learns a conditional spatial query from the decoder embedding for decoder multi-head cross-attention. The benefit is that through the conditional spatial query, each cross-attention head is able to attend to a band containing a distinct region, e.g., one object extremity or a region inside the object box. This narrows down the spatial range for localizing the distinct regions for object classification and box regression, thus relaxing the dependence on the content embeddings and easing the training. Empirical results show that conditional DETR converges 6.7¡Á faster for the backbones R50 and R101 and 10¡Á faster for stronger backbones DC5-R50 and DC5-R101.; ; You can use the raw model for object detection.

Moreover, we apply Noah-Wukong dataset (100M) and Zero dataset (23M) as the pre-training datasets. The model was first trained 24 epochs on wukong and zero, which takes 6 days to train on A100x32. To the best of our knowledge, our TaiyiCLIP is currently the only open-sourced Chinese CLIP in the huggingface community.; Zero-Shot Classification"

Although a series of successful portrait image toonification models built upon the powerful StyleGAN have been proposed, these image-oriented methods have obvious limitations when applied to videos, such as the fixed frame size, the requirement of face alignment, missing non-facial details and temporal inconsistency. In this work, we investigate the challenging controllable high-resolution portrait video style transfer by introducing a novel VToonify framework. Specifically, VToonify leverages the mid- and high-resolution layers of StyleGAN to render high-quality artistic portraits based on the multi-scale content features extracted by an encoder to better preserve the frame details. The resulting fully convolutional architecture accepts non-aligned faces in videos of variable size as input, contributing to complete face regions with natural motions in the output. Our framework is compatible with existing StyleGAN-based image toonification models to extend them to video toonification, and inherits appealing features of these models for flexible style control on color and intensity. This work presents two instantiations of VToonify built upon Toonify and DualStyleGAN for collection-based and exemplar-based portrait video style transfer, respectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed VToonify framework over existing methods in generating high-quality and temporally-coherent artistic portrait videos with flexible style controls.; S-Lab License 1.0"

We show inputs and its corresponding outputs of each instances in each dataset to FLIPPED, and train it to generate its possible instruction. We add unlikelihood loss in order not to generate the instruction when given the same input, but a wrong output. To obtain FLIPPED, we fine-tune a T5 model in a given scale on a multitask mixture covering many different classification NLP tasks.; You can use the models to perform inference on tasks by specifying your input-output NLP query in a ""input: {input}\noutput: {output}"" form , and the model will predict the instruction.

Include any mix of these words in the prompt to produce verying results, or exclude them to have a less pronounced effect.
There is usually at least a slight stylistic effect even without the words, but it is recommended to include at least one.
Adding token word/phrase class word/phrase at the start of the prompt in that order produces results most similar to the trained concept, but they can be included elsewhere as well. Some models produce better results when not including all token/class words.; 3k models are are more flexible, while 5k models produce images closer to the trained concept.
I recommend 2k/3k models for normal use, and 5k/6k models for model merging and use without token/class words.

In this paper, for the first time, we investigate exemplar-guided image editing for more precise control. We achieve this goal by leveraging self-supervised training to disentangle and re-organize the source image and the exemplar. However, the naive approach will cause obvious fusing artifacts. We carefully analyze it and propose an information bottleneck and strong augmentations to avoid the trivial solution of directly copying and pasting the exemplar image. Meanwhile, to ensure the controllability of the editing process, we design an arbitrary shape mask for the exemplar image and leverage the classifier-free guidance to increase the similarity to the exemplar image. The whole framework involves a single forward of the diffusion model without any iterative optimization. We demonstrate that our method achieves an impressive performance and enables controllable editing on in-the-wild images with high fidelity.; The original codebase can be found here.; Inference API has been turned off for this model."

However, most existing pre-trained models only excel in either understanding-based tasks or generation-based tasks. Furthermore, performance improvement has been largely achieved by scaling up the dataset with noisy image-text pairs collected from the web, which is a suboptimal source of supervision. In this paper, we propose BLIP, a new VLP framework which transfers flexibly to both vision-language understanding and generation tasks. BLIP effectively utilizes the noisy web data by bootstrapping the captions, where a captioner generates synthetic captions and a filter removes the noisy ones. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of vision-language tasks, such as image-text retrieval (+2.7% in average recall@1), image captioning (+2.8% in CIDEr), and VQA (+1.6% in VQA score). BLIP also demonstrates strong generalization ability when directly transferred to videolanguage tasks in a zero-shot manner.

Specifically, UIE uniformly encodes different extraction structures via a structured extraction language, adaptively generates target extractions via a schema-based prompt mechanism - structural schema instructor, and captures the common IE abilities via a large-scale pre-trained text-to-structure model. Experiments show that UIE achieved the state-of-the-art performance on 4 IE tasks, 13 datasets, and on all supervised, low-resource, and few-shot settings for a wide range of entity, relation, event and sentiment extraction tasks and their unification.

Firstly, it does not always stay true to your prompts; it adds irrelevant details, and sometimes these details are highly homogenized. Secondly, it is an unstable, overfitted model, similar to Anything3.0, and is not suitable for any form of further training. As far as I know, Anything3.0 is obtained by merging several models in just the right way, but it is itself an overfitted model with defects in both its saturation and configuration. However, as I mentioned earlier, it can make even poorly written prompts produce good output images, which leads many lazy people who are incapable of writing good prompts to quickly surpass those who study the writing of prompts carefully. Despite these problems, I still want to release an extended version of the model that caters to the preferences of many people in the community. I hope would you like it.; In my personal view, I oppose all forms of model merging as it has no scientific principle and is nothing but a waste of time.

same data, in the exact same order. We also provide 154 intermediate 
checkpoints per model, hosted on Hugging Face as branches.; The Pythia model suite was designed to promote scientific 
research on large language models, especially interpretability research.

models match or exceed the performance of 
similar and same-sized models, such as those in the OPT and GPT-Neo suites.; Previously, we released an early version of the Pythia suite to the public.

The model was then fine-tuned on the XNLI dataset, which contains hypothesis-premise pairs from 15 languages, 
as well as the English MNLI dataset.; The main advantage of distilled models is that they are smaller (faster inference, lower memory requirements) than their teachers (XLM-RoBERTa-large).
The disadvantage is that they lose some of the performance of their larger teachers. ; For highest inference speed, I recommend using this 6-layer model. For higher performance I recommend 
mDeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-xnli (as of 14.02.2023).; This model was trained on the XNLI development dataset and the MNLI train dataset. 
The XNLI development set consists of 2490 professionally translated texts from English 
to 14 other languages (37350 texts in total) (see this paper). 
Note that the XNLI contains a training set of 15 machine translated versions of the MNLI dataset for 15 languages, 
but due to quality issues with these machine translations, this model was only trained on the professional translations 
from the XNLI development set and the original English MNLI training set (392 702 texts). 
Not using machine translated texts can avoid overfitting the model to the 15 languages; 
avoids catastrophic forgetting of the other languages it was pre-trained on; 
and significantly reduces training costs. ; The model was trained using the Hugging Face trainer with the following hyperparameters. 
The exact underlying model is mMiniLMv2-L6-H384-distilled-from-XLMR-Large."

in collaboration with Stability AI. 
This model was trained on a high-resolution subset of the LAION-2B dataset. 
It is a diffusion model that operates in the same latent space as the Stable Diffusion model, which is decoded into a full-resolution image. 
To use it with Stable Diffusion, You can take the generated latent from Stable Diffusion and pass it into the upscaler before decoding with your standard VAE. 
Or you can take any image, encode it into the latent space, use the upscaler, and decode it. ; Note: 
This upscaling model is designed explicitely for Stable Diffusion as it can upscale Stable Diffusion's latent denoised image embeddings.
This allows for very fast text-to-image + upscaling pipelines as all intermeditate states can be kept on GPU. More for information, see example below.

We found that laion/CLIP-ViT-B-32-laion2B-s34B-b79K checkpoint (thanks Bin!) worked better than original OpenAI CLIP on Fashion. We thus fine-tune a newer (and better!) version of FashionCLIP (henceforth FashionCLIP 2.0), while keeping the architecture the same. We postulate that the perofrmance gains afforded by laion/CLIP-ViT-B-32-laion2B-s34B-b79K are due to the increased training data (5x OpenAI CLIP data). Our thesis, however, remains the same -- fine-tuning laion/CLIP on our fashion dataset improved zero-shot perofrmance across our benchmarks. See the below table comparing weighted macro F1 score across models.; FashionCLIP is a CLIP-based model developed to produce general product representations for fashion concepts. Leveraging the pre-trained checkpoint (ViT-B/32) released by OpenAI, we train FashionCLIP on a large, high-quality novel fashion dataset to study whether domain specific fine-tuning of CLIP-like models is sufficient to produce product representations that are zero-shot transferable to entirely new datasets and tasks.

interpretability research (see paper). 
It contains two sets of eight models of sizes 
70M, 160M, 410M, 1B, 1.4B, 2.8B, 6.9B, and 12B. For each size, there are two 
models: one trained on the Pile, and one trained on the Pile after the dataset 
has been globally deduplicated. All 8 model sizes are trained on the exact 
same data, in the exact same order. We also provide 154 intermediate 
checkpoints per model, hosted on Hugging Face as branches.; The Pythia model suite was deliberately designed to promote scientific 
research on large language models, especially interpretability research. 
Despite not centering downstream performance as a design goal, we find the 
models match or exceed the performance of 
similar and same-sized models, such as those in the OPT and GPT-Neo suites.; Previously, we released an early version of the Pythia suite to the public. 
However, we decided to retrain the model suite to address a few hyperparameter 
discrepancies. This model card lists the changes; 
see appendix B in the Pythia paper for further discussion. We found no 
difference in benchmark performance between the two Pythia versions. 
The old models are 
still available, but we 
suggest the retrained suite if you are just starting to use Pythia.
This is the current release.; Please note that all models in the Pythia suite were renamed in January 
2023. For clarity, a table 
comparing the old and new names is provided in this model card, together 
with exact parameter counts.; The primary intended use of Pythia is research on the behavior, functionality, 
and limitations of large language models. This suite is intended to provide 
a controlled setting for performing scientific experiments. We also provide 
154 checkpoints per model: initial step0, 10 log-spaced checkpoints 
step{1,2,4...512}, and 143 evenly-spaced checkpoints from step1000 to 
step143000. These checkpoints are hosted on Hugging Face as branches. Note 
that branch 143000 corresponds exactly to the model checkpoint on the main 
branch of each model."

In this paper, we propose a pipeline of contrastive language-audio pretraining to develop an audio representation by combining audio data with natural language descriptions. To accomplish this target, we first release LAION-Audio-630K, a large collection of 633,526 audio-text pairs from different data sources. Second, we construct a contrastive language-audio pretraining model by considering different audio encoders and text encoders. We incorporate the feature fusion mechanism and keyword-to-caption augmentation into the model design to further enable the model to process audio inputs of variable lengths and enhance the performance. Third, we perform comprehensive experiments to evaluate our model across three tasks: text-to-audio retrieval, zero-shot audio classification, and supervised audio classification. The results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance in text-to-audio retrieval task. In audio classification tasks, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot setting and is able to obtain performance comparable to models' results in the non-zero-shot setting.

pix2struct-screen2words-base,Visual Question Answering,PyTorch; Transformers,5 languages,apache-2.0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03347.pdf,14,,120,1161.236585,1,https://huggingface.co/google/pix2struct-screen2words-base,"; Pix2Struct is an image encoder - text decoder model that is trained on image-text pairs for various tasks, including image captionning and visual question answering. The full list of available models can be found on the Table 1 of the paper:; ; The abstract of the model states that: ; Visually-situated language is ubiquitous¡ªsources range from textbooks with diagrams to web pages with images and tables, to mobile apps with buttons and
forms. Perhaps due to this diversity, previous work has typically relied on domainspecific recipes with limited sharing of the underlying data, model architectures,
and objectives. We present Pix2Struct, a pretrained image-to-text model for
purely visual language understanding, which can be finetuned on tasks containing visually-situated language. Pix2Struct is pretrained by learning to parse
masked screenshots of web pages into simplified HTML. The web, with its richness of visual elements cleanly reflected in the HTML structure, provides a large
source of pretraining data well suited to the diversity of downstream tasks. Intuitively, this objective subsumes common pretraining signals such as OCR, language modeling, image captioning. In addition to the novel pretraining strategy,
we introduce a variable-resolution input representation and a more flexible integration of language and vision inputs, where language prompts such as questions
are rendered directly on top of the input image. For the first time, we show that a
single pretrained model can achieve state-of-the-art results in six out of nine tasks
across four domains: documents, illustrations, user interfaces, and natural images."

I usually find good results at 0.65 weigth that I later offset to 1.; This is good for inference (again, especially with styles) even if I made it mainly for training. It ended up being super good for generating pics and it's now my go-to anime model. It also eats very little vram.; The first version I'm uploading is a fp16-pruned with no baked vae, which is less than 2 GB, meaning you can get up to 6 epochs in the same batch on a colab.; Just make sure you use CLIP skip two and booru style tags when training. Remember to use a good VAE when generating, or images will look desaturated. I suggest WD Vae or FT MSE. Or you can use the baked vae version."

It is based on LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) and contains 7 billion parameters. 
The primary goal of this model is to improve question-answering and medical dialogue tasks.
Architecture; The training data for this project was sourced from various resources. 
Firstly, we used Anki flashcards to automatically generate questions, 
from the front of the cards and anwers from the back of the card. 
Secondly, we generated medical question-answer pairs from Wikidoc. 
We extracted paragraphs with relevant headings, and used Chat-GPT 3.5 
to generate questions from the headings and using the corresponding paragraphs 
as answers. This dataset is still under development and we believe 
that approximately 70% of these question answer pairs are factual correct. 
Thirdly, we used StackExchange to extract question-answer pairs, taking the 
top-rated question from five categories: Academia, Bioinformatics, Biology, 
Fitness, and Health. Additionally, we used a dataset from ChatDoctor 
consisting of 200,000 question-answer pairs, available at https://github.com/Kent0n-Li/ChatDoctor.; To evaluate the performance of the model on a specific dataset, you can use the Hugging Face Transformers library's built-in evaluation scripts. Please refer to the evaluation guide for more information.
Inference; You can use the model for inference tasks like question-answering and medical dialogues using the Hugging Face Transformers library. Here's an example of how to use the model for a question-answering task:"

For more info check out the blog post and github example.; Llama-se-rm is a Llama-based model that has been first fine-tuned on the Stack Exchange dataset and used for reward modeling using a Stack Exchange Data. 
This dataset consists of questions and answers from various domains in Stack Exchange, such as programming, mathematics, physics, and more. 
The model is designed to generate human-like responses to questions in these domains. 
The model has been training to respond to prompts with the following template:; The Llama-se-rm model was trained for long form QA using Stack Exchange data wich is released under a CC-BY-SA 4.0, and covers topics such as programming, mathematics, and physics.
It is intended to demonstrate a Large Language Model's ability to follow a target behavior (in this case, generating answers to a question that would have been rated more highly on SE).
It is not intended to replace human expertise, and answers should be validated through the use of external sources.
Further research is also needed to attribute model generations to sources in the training data, especially in cases where the model may copy answers from the training data verbatim.  ; The Llama-se-rm model inherits limitations and biases from the Llama model and also those contained in the Stack Exchange dataset.
In particular, per the latest developer survey for Stack Overflow,
which constitutes a significant part of the StackExchange data,
most users who answered the survey identified themselves as White or European, men, between 25 and 34 years old, and based in the US (with a significant part of responders from India).
While this demographic information likely varies by topic, disparities between the data contributors and the direct and indirect users of the technology should inform developers in assessing what constitutes an appropriate use case."

Paella,,,,mit,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.07292.pdf,36,,0,7886.828477,,https://huggingface.co/dome272/Paella,"; We are releasing a new Paella model which builds on top of our initial paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07292.
Paella is a text-to-image model that works in a quantized latent space and learns similarly to MUSE and Diffusion models.
Since the paper-release we worked intensively to bring Paella to a similar level as other 
state-of-the-art models. With this release we are coming a step closer to that goal. However, our main intention is not
to make the greatest text-to-image model out there (at least for now), it is to bring text-to-image models closer
to people outside the field on a technical basis. For example, many models have codebases with many thousand lines of 
code, that make it pretty hard for people to dive into the code and easily understand it. And that is the contribution
we are the most with Paella. The training and sampling code for Paella is minimalistic and can be understood in a few
minutes, making further extensions, quick tests, idea testing etc. extremely fast. For instance, the entire
sampling code can be written in just 12 lines of code.; Paella works in a quantized latent space, just like StableDiffusion etc., to reduce the computational power needed.
Images will be encoded to a smaller latent space and converted to visual tokens of shape h x w. Now during training,
these visual tokens will be noised, by replacing a random amount of tokens with other randomly selected tokens
from the codebook of the VQGAN. The noised image will be given to the model, along with a timestep and the conditional
information, which is text in our case. The model is tasked to predict the un-noised version of the tokens. 
And that's it. The model is optimized with the CrossEntropy loss between the original tokens and the predicted tokens.
The amount of noise added during the training is just a linear schedule, meaning that we uniformly sample a percentage 
between 0 and 100% and noise that amount of tokens.; Sampling is also extremely simple, we start with the entire image being random tokens. Then we feed the latent image, 
the timestep and the condition into the model and let it predict the final image. The models outputs a distribution
over every token, which we sample from with standard multinomial sampling.Since there are infinite possibilities for the result to look like, just doing a single step results in very basic 
shapes without any details. That is why we add noise to the image again and feed it back to the model. And we repeat
that process for a number of times with less noise being added every time and slowly get our final image.
You can see how images emerge here.

dlite-v2-355m (and all other members of the dlite-v2 family) is licensed for both research and commercial use. We are extremely grateful 
for the work that Databricks has done to create the databricks-dolly-15k dataset, for without it we would not be able to create and release this
model under such an open and permissive license.; While dlite-v2-355m is not a state-of-the-art model, we believe that the level of interactivity that can be achieved on such a small model that is trained so cheaply
is important to showcase, as it continues to demonstrate that creating powerful AI capabilities may be much more accessible than previously thought. ; dlite-v2-355m is not a state-of-the-art language model. dlite-v2-355m is an experimental technology, and as with any experimental technology, 
AI Squared urges potential users of this technology to test its capabilities thoroughly before usage.

Focal modulation comprises three components: (i) hierarchical contextualization, implemented using a stack of depth-wise convolutional layers, to encode visual contexts from short to long ranges, (ii) gated aggregation to selectively gather contexts for each query token based on its
content, and (iii) element-wise modulation or affine transformation to inject the aggregated context into the query. Extensive experiments show FocalNets outperform the state-of-the-art SA counterparts (e.g., Vision Transformers, Swin and Focal Transformers) with similar computational costs on the tasks of image classification, object detection, and segmentation.; ; You can use the raw model for image classification.

FunASR provides an efficient VAD model based on the FSMN structure. To improve model discrimination, we use monophones as modeling units, given the relatively rich speech information. During inference, the VAD system requires post-processing for improved robustness, including operations such as threshold settings and sliding windows.; This repository demonstrates how to leverage FSMN-VAD in conjunction with the funasr_onnx runtime. The underlying model is derived from FunASR, which was trained on a massive 5,000-hour dataset.; We have relesed numerous industrial-grade models, including speech recognition, voice activity detection, punctuation restoration, speaker verification, speaker diarization, and timestamp prediction (force alignment). To learn more about these models, kindly refer to the documentation available on FunASR.

It is designed to provide natural and engaging responses to user input, with a focus on maintaining a consistent tone and style throughout the conversation. The model is suitable for use in both text-based and voice-based interfaces, and can be easily integrated into existing applications using the PyTorch and Transformers frameworks.; The model is trained on a large dataset of conversational data, consisting of interactions between users and an AI assistant. The data is preprocessed to remove any sensitive information and is formatted in a way that is suitable for training a language model. The training data is split into a training set and a validation set, with the training set used to update the model parameters and the validation set used to evaluate the model performance. The model was trained on 245,000 examples over 1,225,000 steps, it achieved decent metrics.
This model outperformed the base GPT-2 model significantly on a new conversational dataset during a fine-tuning session. Here is a side-by-side comparison of the two models during the first steps of training ; The model architecture used in this model is GPT-2, a transformer-based language model that is capable of generating high-quality text with a wide range of styles and tones. The GPT-2 architecture consists of a multi-layered transformer encoder-decoder, with self-attention mechanisms that allow the model to capture long-term dependencies and generate coherent text.; The model is evaluated based on several metrics, including loss, reward, penalty, BLEU score, and perplexity. The loss metric is calculated during training and reflects the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. The reward metric is based on the number of correct words generated by the model, while the penalty metric penalizes the model for repeating words consecutively. The BLEU score measures the similarity between the generated text and the ground truth text, while the perplexity metric measures how well the model is able to predict the next word in a sequence. During validation, the model achieved the following metrics:; Although these metrics seem mediocre, it's actually better because that way the model is able to make open-ended responses, but is still coherent to the user's input."

Among the two main branches of pre-trained language models in the general language domain, i.e. BERT (and its variants) and GPT (and its variants), the first one has been extensively studied in the biomedical domain, such as BioBERT and PubMedBERT. While they have achieved great success on a variety of discriminative downstream biomedical tasks, the lack of generation ability constrains their application scope. In this paper, we propose BioGPT, a domain-specific generative Transformer language model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical literature. We evaluate BioGPT on six biomedical natural language processing tasks and demonstrate that our model outperforms previous models on most tasks. Especially, we get 44.98%, 38.42% and 40.76% F1 score on BC5CDR, KD-DTI and DDI end-to-end relation extraction tasks, respectively, and 78.2% accuracy on PubMedQA, creating a new record. Our case study on text generation further demonstrates the advantage of BioGPT on biomedical literature to generate fluent descriptions for biomedical terms."

Big thanks to the Huggingface and Diffusers team for organising the JAX Diffusers sprint, giving support and making the JAX training scripts. Big thanks to StabilityAI for opensourcing the Stable Diffusion model, it has made a great impact on the community!; To make this demo as good as possible, our team spend a lot of time training a custom model. We used the LAION5B dataset to build our custom dataset, which contains 130k images of 15 types of rooms in almost 30 design styles. After fetching all these images, we started adding metadata such as captions (from the BLIP captioning model) and segmentation maps (from the HuggingFace UperNetForSemanticSegmentation model).; This dataset was then used to train the controlnet model to generate quality interior design images by using the segmentation maps and prompts as conditioning information for the model. By training on segmentation maps, the end user has a very finegrained control over which objects they want to place in their room.
The training started from the lllyasviel/control_v11p_sd15_seg checkpoint, which is a robustly trained controlnet model conditioned on segmentation maps. This checkpoint got fine-tuned on a TPUv4 with the JAX framework. Afterwards, the checkpoint was converted into a PyTorch checkpoint for easy integration with the diffusers library.; Our team made a streamlit demo where you can test out the capabilities of this model.
The resulting model is used in a community pipeline that supports image2image and inpainting, so the user can keep elements of their room and change specific parts of the image.

for relative position encoding. It is a training example
of the perceiver-io library.; Perceiver AR is a simple extension of a plain decoder-only transformer such as GPT-2, for example. A core building block 
of both is the decoder layer consisting of a self-attention layer followed by a position-wise MLP. Self-attention uses 
a causal attention mask.; Perceiver AR additionally cross-attends to a longer prefix of the input sequence in its first attention layer. This layer
is a hybrid self- and cross-attention layer. Self-attention is over the last n positions of the input sequence, with a 
causal attention mask, cross-attention is from the last n positions to the first m positions. The length of the input 
sequence is m + n. This allows a Perceiver AR to process a much larger context than decoder-only transformers which are 
based on self-attention only.;

This approach allows the model to adapt to specific patterns or features in the data, rather than making assumptions based on general trends.; Granular adaptive learning can be achieved through techniques such as active learning, which allows the model to select the data it wants to learn from, or through the use of reinforcement learning, where the model receives feedback on its performance and adapts based on that feedback. It can also be achieved through techniques such as online learning where the model adjust itself as it receives more data.; Granular adaptive learning is often used in situations where the data is highly diverse or non-stationary and where the model needs to adapt quickly to changing patterns. This is often the case in dynamic environments such as robotics, financial markets, and natural language processing."

It is designed to provide natural and engaging responses to user input, with a focus on maintaining a consistent tone and style throughout the conversation. The model is suitable for use in both text-based and voice-based interfaces, and can be easily integrated into existing applications using the PyTorch and Transformers frameworks.; The model is trained on a large dataset of conversational data, consisting of interactions between users and an AI assistant. The data is preprocessed to remove any sensitive information and is formatted in a way that is suitable for training a language model. The training data is split into a training set and a validation set, with the training set used to update the model parameters and the validation set used to evaluate the model performance. The model was trained on 302,000 examples over 502,505 steps, it achieved decent metrics.; The model architecture used in this model is GPT-2, a transformer-based language model that is capable of generating high-quality text with a wide range of styles and tones. The GPT-2 architecture consists of a multi-layered transformer encoder-decoder, with self-attention mechanisms that allow the model to capture long-term dependencies and generate coherent text.; The model is evaluated based on several metrics, including loss, reward, penalty, BLEU score, and perplexity. The loss metric is calculated during training and reflects the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. The reward metric is based on the number of correct words generated by the model, while the penalty metric penalizes the model for repeating words consecutively. The BLEU score measures the similarity between the generated text and the ground truth text, while the perplexity metric measures how well the model is able to predict the next word in a sequence. During validation, the model achieved the following metrics:; This model is not suitable for all use cases due to its limited training time on a weak computer. As a result, it may produce irrelevant or nonsensical responses. Additionally, it has not been fine-tuned to remember the chat history, is unable to provide follow-up responses, and it does not know the answer to many questions (it was only fine-tuned to respond in a conversational way). For optimal performance, we recommend using a GPU with at least 8GB of VRAM and downloading the model manually instead of using the Transformers library. Here's how you should deploy the model:"

; This is the result of the ZhiXi-13B LoRA weights. You can click here to learn more.; With the rapid development of deep learning technology, large language models such as ChatGPT have made substantial strides in the realm of natural language processing. However, these expansive models still encounter several challenges in acquiring and comprehending knowledge, including the difficulty of updating knowledge and potential knowledge discrepancies and biases, collectively known as knowledge fallacies. The KnowLM project endeavors to tackle these issues by launching an open-source large-scale knowledgable language model framework and releasing corresponding models. ; The project's initial phase introduced a knowledge extraction LLM based on LLaMA, dubbed ZhiXi (ÖÇÎö, which means intelligent analysis of data for information extraction). To integrate the capacity of Chinese understanding into the language models without compromising their inherent knowledge, we firstly (1) use Chinese corpora for the full-scale pre-training with LLaMA (13B), augment the language model's understanding of Chinese and improve its knowledge richness while retaining its original English and code capacities; Then (2) we fine-tune the model obtained from the first step with an instruction dataset, thus bolstering the language model's understanding of human instructions for knowledge extraction.; The features of this project are as follows:"

https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11846; Open Source Checklist:; We present Composable Diffusion (CoDi), a novel generative model capable of generating any combination of output modalities, such as language, image, video, or audio, from any combination of input modalities. Unlike existing generative AI systems, CoDi can generate multiple modalities in parallel and its input is not limited to a subset of modalities like text or image. Despite the absence of training datasets for many combinations of modalities, we propose to align modalities in both the input and output space. This allows CoDi to freely condition on any input combination and generate any group of modalities, even if they are not present in the training data. CoDi employs a novel composable generation strategy which involves building a shared multimodal space by bridging alignment in the diffusion process, enabling the synchronized generation of intertwined modalities, such as temporally aligned video and audio. Highly customizable and flexible, CoDi achieves strong joint-modality generation quality, and outperforms or is on par with the unimodal state-of-the-art for single-modality synthesis.  ; If you find our work useful, please consider citing:; Zineng Tang (zn.tang.terran@gmail.com)"

This research paper proposes a Latent Diffusion Model for 3D (LDM3D) that generates both image and depth map data from a given text prompt, allowing users to generate RGBD images from text prompts. The LDM3D model is fine-tuned on a dataset of tuples containing an RGB image, depth map and caption, and validated through extensive experiments. We also develop an application called DepthFusion, which uses the generated RGB images and depth maps to create immersive and interactive 360-degree-view experiences using TouchDesigner. This technology has the potential to transform a wide range of industries, from entertainment and gaming to architecture and design. Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of generative AI and computer vision, and showcases the potential of LDM3D and DepthFusion to revolutionize content creation and digital experiences.; 
LDM3D overview taken from the original paper; You can use this model to generate RGB and depth map given a text prompt.

The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of GRAPHIX-T5 and underscore the importance of incorporating structural information in text-to-text PLMs for tackling intricate text-to-SQL challenges. 
The smaller gap in performance between the dev and test sets indicates the stronger generalization capability of Graphix-T5.; Graphix-3B is trained based on SPIDER, a cross-domain text-to-SQL benchmark. And it's evaluated in vanilla SPIDER dev, test, and other variants: SPIDER-SYN, SPIDER-DK,

This example generates a different sequence each time it's run:; Graphix-3B w/ Picard maintains state-of-the-art (SOTA) semantic parsing capabilities, as demonstrated by its performance on the SPIDER leaderboard.

Firstly, we used Anki flashcards to automatically generate questions, 
from the front of the cards and anwers from the back of the card. 
Secondly, we generated medical question-answer pairs from Wikidoc. 
We extracted paragraphs with relevant headings, and used Chat-GPT 3.5 
to generate questions from the headings and using the corresponding paragraphs 
as answers. This dataset is still under development and we believe 
that approximately 70% of these question answer pairs are factual correct. 
Thirdly, we used StackExchange to extract question-answer pairs, taking the 
top-rated question from five categories: Academia, Bioinformatics, Biology, 
Fitness, and Health. Additionally, we used a dataset from ChatDoctor 
consisting of 200,000 question-answer pairs, available at https://github.com/Kent0n-Li/ChatDoctor."

It is based on the Guanaco LORA of LLaMA weighing in at 65B parameters. 
The primary goal of this model is to improve question-answering and medical dialogue tasks.
It was trained using LoRA and reduced to 8bit, to reduce memory footprint. ; Steps to load this model:; The following README is taken from the source page medalpaca; The training data for this project was sourced from various resources. 
Firstly, we used Anki flashcards to automatically generate questions, 
from the front of the cards and anwers from the back of the card. 
Secondly, we generated medical question-answer pairs from Wikidoc. 
We extracted paragraphs with relevant headings, and used Chat-GPT 3.5 
to generate questions from the headings and using the corresponding paragraphs 
as answers. This dataset is still under development and we believe 
that approximately 70% of these question answer pairs are factual correct. 
Thirdly, we used StackExchange to extract question-answer pairs, taking the 
top-rated question from five categories: Academia, Bioinformatics, Biology, 
Fitness, and Health. Additionally, we used a dataset from ChatDoctor 
consisting of 200,000 question-answer pairs, available at https://github.com/Kent0n-Li/ChatDoctor."

See an example output that has been upscaled to 1152 x 640 using Potat1.; For upscaling, it's recommended to use Potat1 via vid2vid in the 1111 extension. Aim for a resolution of 1152x640 and a denoise strength between 0.66 and 0.85. Remember to use the same prompt and settings that were used to generate the original clip.; Lower resolutions or fewer frames could lead to suboptimal output. 
Certain clips might appear with cuts. This will be fixed in the upcoming 2.1 version, which will incorporate a cleaner dataset.
Some clips may playback too slowly, requiring prompt engineering for an increased pace."

It is designed to provide natural and engaging responses to user input, with a focus on maintaining a consistent tone and style throughout the conversation. The model is suitable for use in both text-based and voice-based interfaces, and can be easily integrated into existing applications using the PyTorch and Transformers frameworks.; The model is trained on a large dataset of conversational data, consisting of interactions between users and an AI assistant. The data is preprocessed to remove any sensitive information and is formatted in a way that is suitable for training a language model. The training data is split into a training set and a validation set, with the training set used to update the model parameters and the validation set used to evaluate the model performance. The model was trained on 550,000 examples over 687,500 steps, it achieved decent metrics.; The model architecture used in this model is GPT-2, a transformer-based language model that is capable of generating high-quality text with a wide range of styles and tones. The GPT-2 architecture consists of a multi-layered transformer encoder-decoder, with self-attention mechanisms that allow the model to capture long-term dependencies and generate coherent text.; The model is evaluated based on several metrics, including loss, reward, penalty, BLEU score, and perplexity. The loss metric is calculated during training and reflects the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. The reward metric is based on the number of correct words generated by the model, while the penalty metric penalizes the model for repeating words consecutively. The BLEU score measures the similarity between the generated text and the ground truth text, while the perplexity metric measures how well the model is able to predict the next word in a sequence. During validation, the model achieved the following metrics:; This model is not suitable for all use cases due to its limited training time on a weak computer. As a result, it may produce irrelevant or nonsensical responses. Additionally, it has not been fine-tuned to remember the chat history, is unable to provide follow-up responses, and it does not know the answer to many questions (it was only fine-tuned to respond in a conversational way). For optimal performance, I recommend using a GPU with at least 12 GB of VRAM and downloading the model manually instead of using the Transformers library. Here's how you should deploy the model:"
