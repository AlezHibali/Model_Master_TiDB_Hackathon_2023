zeroscope_v2_576w,,,,,,,,,"; A watermark-free Modelscope-based video model optimized for producing high-quality 16:9 compositions and a smooth video output. This model was trained from the original weights using 9,923 clips and 29,769 tagged frames at 24 frames, 576x320 resolution.
zeroscope_v2_567w is specifically designed for upscaling with zeroscope_v2_XL using vid2vid in the 1111 text2video extension by kabachuha. Leveraging this model as a preliminary step allows for superior overall compositions at higher resolutions in zeroscope_v2_XL, permitting faster exploration in 576x320 before transitioning to a high-resolution render. See some example outputs that have been upscaled to 1024x576 using zeroscope_v2_XL.

long_llama_3b,,,,,,,,,"; TLDR | Overview | Usage | LongLLaMA performance | Authors | Citation | License | Acknowledgments; This repository contains the research preview of LongLLaMA, a large language model capable of handling long contexts of 256k tokens or even more. ; LongLLaMA is built upon the foundation of OpenLLaMA and fine-tuned using the Focused Transformer (FoT) method.  We release a smaller 3B variant of the LongLLaMA model on a permissive license (Apache 2.0) and inference code supporting longer contexts on Hugging Face. Our model weights can serve as the drop-in replacement of LLaMA in existing implementations (for short context up to 2048 tokens). Additionally, we provide evaluation results and comparisons against the original OpenLLaMA models. Stay tuned for further updates.; Focused Transformer: Contrastive Training for Context Scaling (FoT) presents a simple method for endowing language models with the ability to handle context consisting possibly of millions of tokens while training on significantly shorter input. FoT permits a subset of attention layers to access a memory cache of (key, value) pairs to extend the context length. The distinctive aspect of FoT is its training procedure, drawing from contrastive learning. Specifically, we deliberately expose the memory attention layers to both relevant and irrelevant keys (like negative samples from unrelated documents). This strategy incentivizes the model to differentiate keys connected with semantically diverse values, thereby enhancing their structure. This, in turn, makes it possible to extrapolate the effective context length much beyond what is seen in training.

The method works by posing the sequence to be classified as the NLI premise and to construct a hypothesis from each candidate label. For example, if we want to evaluate whether a sequence belongs to the class ""politics"", we could construct a hypothesis of This text is about politics.. The probabilities for entailment and contradiction are then converted to label probabilities.; This method is surprisingly effective in many cases, particularly when used with larger pre-trained models like BART and Roberta.

The intent was to fine-tune on the Stable Diffusion training set (the autoencoder was originally trained on OpenImages) but also enrich the dataset with images of humans to improve the reconstruction of faces.
The first, ft-EMA, was resumed from the original checkpoint, trained for 313198 steps and uses EMA weights. It uses the same loss configuration as the original checkpoint (L1 + LPIPS).
The second, ft-MSE, was resumed from ft-EMA and uses EMA weights and was trained for another 280k steps using a different loss, with more emphasis 
on MSE reconstruction (MSE + 0.1 * LPIPS). It produces somewhat ``smoother'' outputs. The batch size for both versions was 192 (16 A100s, batch size 12 per GPU).

StarChat-¦Â is the second model in the series, and is a fine-tuned version of StarCoderPlus that was trained on an ""uncensored"" variant of the openassistant-guanaco dataset. We found that removing the in-built alignment of the OpenAssistant dataset boosted performance on the Open LLM Leaderboard and made the model more helpful at coding tasks. However, this means that model is likely to generate problematic text when prompted to do so and should only be used for educational and research purposes.; The model was fine-tuned on a variant of the OpenAssistant/oasst1 dataset, which contains a diverse range of dialogues in over 35 languages. As a result, the model can be used for chat and you can check out our demo to test its coding capabilities. ; Here's how you can run the model using the pipeline() function from ? Transformers:; StarChat-¦Â has not been aligned to human preferences with techniques like RLHF or deployed with in-the-loop filtering of responses like ChatGPT, so the model can produce problematic outputs (especially when prompted to do so).

controlnet_qrcode-control_v1p_sd15,,,,,,,,,"; This repo holds the safetensors & diffusers versions of the QR code conditioned ControlNet for Stable Diffusion v1.5.
The Stable Diffusion 2.1 version is marginally more effective, as it was developed to address my specific needs. However, this 1.5 version model was also trained on the same dataset for those who are using the older version.; These models perform quite well in most cases, but please note that they are not 100% accurate. In some instances, the QR code shape might not come through as expected. You can increase the ControlNet weight to emphasize the QR code shape. However, be cautious as this might negatively impact the style of your output.To optimize for scanning, please generate your QR codes with correction mode 'H' (30%).; To balance between style and shape, a gentle fine-tuning of the control weight might be required based on the individual input and the desired output, aswell as the correct prompt. Some prompts do not work until you increase the weight by a lot. The process of finding the right balance between these factors is part art and part science. For the best results, it is recommended to generate your artwork at a resolution of 768. This allows for a higher level of detail in the final product, enhancing the quality and effectiveness of the QR code-based artwork.; The simplest way to use this is to place the .safetensors model and its .yaml config file in the folder where your other controlnet models are installed, which varies per application. 
For usage in auto1111 they can be placed in the webui/models/ControlNet folder. They can be loaded using the controlnet webui extension which you can install through the extensions tab in the webui (https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet). Make sure to enable your controlnet unit and set your input image as the QR code. Set the model to either the SD2.1 or 1.5 version depending on your base stable diffusion model, or it will error. No pre-processor is needed, though you can use the invert pre-processor for a different variation of results. 768 is the preferred resolution for generation since it allows for more detail.
Make sure to look up additional info on how to use controlnet if you get stuck, once you have the webui up and running its really easy to install the controlnet extension aswell.",computer-vision,image-to-image,https://huggingface.co/DionTimmer/controlnet_qrcode-control_v1p_sd15,,License: openrail++,,English,Diffusers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 141,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 51831,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 6.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 53
polylm-13b,,,,,,,,," Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable ability to comprehend, reason, and generate following nature language instructions. However, the development of LLMs has been primarily focused on high-resource languages, such as English, thereby limiting their applicability and research in other languages. Consequently, we present PolyLM, a multilingual LLM trained on 640 billion (B) tokens, avaliable in two model sizes: 1.7B and 13B. To enhance its multilingual capabilities, we 1) integrate bilingual data into training data; and 2) adopt a curriculum learning strategy that increases the proportion of non-English data from 30% in the first stage to 60% in the final stage during pre-training. Further, we propose a multilingual self-instruct method which automatically generates 132.7K  diverse multilingual instructions for model fine-tuning. To assess the model's performance, we collect several existing multilingual tasks, including multilingual understanding, question answering, generation, and translation. Extensive experiments show that PolyLM surpasses other open-source models such as LLaMA and BLOOM on multilingual tasks while maintaining comparable performance in English.; Find below some example scripts on how to use the model in transformers:; The primary use is research on language models, including: research on zero-shot NLP tasks and in-context few-shot learning NLP tasks, such as reasoning, and question answering; advancing fairness and safety research, and understanding limitations of current large language models; See the research paper for further details.; More information needed.",natural-language-processing,text-generation,https://huggingface.co/DAMO-NLP-MT/polylm-13b,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06018.pdf; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09864.pdf,License: apache-2.0,,18 languages,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 25,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 1010,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 31.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 1

You should get the Llama2 base model first, either from Meta or from one of the reuploads on HuggingFace (for example here and here). It is also possible to apply the LoRAs on different Llama2-based models (e.g. LLongMA-2 or Nous-Hermes-Llama2), although this is largely untested and the final results may not work as intended.; This is an experimental attempt at creating an RP-oriented fine-tune using a manually-curated, high-quality dataset of human-generated conversations. The main rationale for this are the observations from Zhou et al.. The authors suggested that just 1000-2000 carefully curated training examples may yield high quality output for assistant-type chatbots. This is in contrast with the commonly employed strategy where a very large number of training examples (tens of thousands to even millions) of widely varying quality are used.; For LIMARP a similar approach was used, with the difference that the conversational data is almost entirely human-generated. Every training example is manually compiled and selected to comply with subjective quality parameters, with virtually no chance for OpenAI-style alignment responses to come up.; The model is intended to approximate the experience of 1-on-1 roleplay as observed on many Internet forums dedicated on roleplaying.

blip-image-captioning-large,,,,,,,,,"Model card for image captioning pretrained on COCO dataset - base architecture (with ViT large backbone).; Authors from the paper write in the abstract:; Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) has advanced the performance for many vision-language tasks. However, most existing pre-trained models only excel in either understanding-based tasks or generation-based tasks. Furthermore, performance improvement has been largely achieved by scaling up the dataset with noisy image-text pairs collected from the web, which is a suboptimal source of supervision. In this paper, we propose BLIP, a new VLP framework which transfers flexibly to both vision-language understanding and generation tasks. BLIP effectively utilizes the noisy web data by bootstrapping the captions, where a captioner generates synthetic captions and a filter removes the noisy ones. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of vision-language tasks, such as image-text retrieval (+2.7% in average recall@1), image captioning (+2.8% in CIDEr), and VQA (+1.6% in VQA score). BLIP also demonstrates strong generalization ability when directly transferred to videolanguage tasks in a zero-shot manner.

the Hugging Face team.; BERT is a transformers model pretrained on a large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion. This means it
was pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labeling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of
publicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. More precisely, it
was pretrained with two objectives:; This way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features
useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled sentences, for instance, you can train a standard
classifier using the features produced by the BERT model as inputs.; BERT has originally been released in base and large variations, for cased and uncased input text. The uncased models also strips out an accent markers.Chinese and multilingual uncased and cased versions followed shortly after.Modified preprocessing with whole word masking has replaced subpiece masking in a following work, with the release of two models.Other 24 smaller models are released afterward.

mDeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-xnli,,,,,,,,,"This multilingual model can perform natural language inference (NLI) on 100 languages and is therefore also suitable for multilingual 
zero-shot classification. The underlying model was pre-trained by Microsoft on the 
CC100 multilingual dataset. It was then fine-tuned on the XNLI dataset, which contains hypothesis-premise pairs from 15 languages, as well as the English MNLI dataset.
As of December 2021, mDeBERTa-base is the best performing multilingual base-sized transformer model, 
introduced by Microsoft in this paper. ; If you are looking for a smaller, faster (but less performant) model, you can 
try multilingual-MiniLMv2-L6-mnli-xnli.; This model was trained on the XNLI development dataset and the MNLI train dataset. The XNLI development set consists of 2490 professionally translated texts from English to 14 other languages (37350 texts in total) (see this paper). Note that the XNLI contains a training set of 15 machine translated versions of the MNLI dataset for 15 languages, but due to quality issues with these machine translations, this model was only trained on the professional translations from the XNLI development set and the original English MNLI training set (392 702 texts). Not using machine translated texts can avoid overfitting the model to the 15 languages; avoids catastrophic forgetting of the other 85 languages mDeBERTa was pre-trained on; and significantly reduces training costs. ; mDeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-xnli was trained using the Hugging Face trainer with the following hyperparameters.; The model was evaluated on the XNLI test set on 15 languages (5010 texts per language, 75150 in total). Note that multilingual NLI models are capable of classifying NLI texts without receiving NLI training data in the specific language (cross-lingual transfer). This means that the model is also able of doing NLI on the other 85 languages mDeBERTa was training on, but performance is most likely lower than for those languages available in XNLI.",natural-language-processing,zero-shot-classification,https://huggingface.co/MoritzLaurer/mDeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-xnli,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.09543.pdf; https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.05053.pdf; https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02116.pdf,License: mit,Datasets: multi_nli; xnli,16 languages,PyTorch; Safetensors; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 144,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 42184,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 1.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 5

roberta-base,,,,,,,,,"Pretrained model on English language using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective. It was introduced in
this paper and first released in

the Hugging Face team.; RoBERTa is a transformers model pretrained on a large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion. This means
it was pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of
publicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. ; More precisely, it was pretrained with the Masked language modeling (MLM) objective. Taking a sentence, the model
randomly masks 15% of the words in the input then run the entire masked sentence through the model and has to predict
the masked words. This is different from traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that usually see the words one
after the other, or from autoregressive models like GPT which internally mask the future tokens. It allows the model to
learn a bidirectional representation of the sentence.; This way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features

In some instances, the QR code shape might not come through as expected. You can increase the ControlNet weight to emphasize the QR code shape. However, be cautious as this might negatively impact the style of your output.To optimize for scanning, please generate your QR codes with correction mode 'H' (30%).; To balance between style and shape, a gentle fine-tuning of the control weight might be required based on the individual input and the desired output, aswell as the correct prompt. Some prompts do not work until you increase the weight by a lot. The process of finding the right balance between these factors is part art and part science. For the best results, it is recommended to generate your artwork at a resolution of 768.

Next, the model was fine-tuned on ImageNet (also referred to as ILSVRC2012), a dataset comprising 1 million images and 1,000 classes, also at resolution 224x224.; Images are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds absolute position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder.; By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of images that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled images for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire image.",computer-vision,image-classification,https://huggingface.co/google/vit-base-patch16-224,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03677.pdf,License: apache-2.0,Datasets: imagenet-1k; imagenet-21k,,PyTorch; TensorFlow; JAX; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 272,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 3378220,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 1.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 116
bloomz,,,,,,,,,"; We present BLOOMZ & mT0, a family of models capable of following human instructions in dozens of languages zero-shot. We finetune BLOOM & mT5 pretrained multilingual language models on our crosslingual task mixture (xP3) and find the resulting models capable of crosslingual generalization to unseen tasks & languages.; We recommend using the model to perform tasks expressed in natural language. For example, given the prompt ""Translate to English: Je t¡¯aime."", the model will most likely answer ""I love you."". Some prompt ideas from our paper: ; Feel free to share your generations in the Community tab!; Prompt Engineering: The performance may vary depending on the prompt. For BLOOMZ models, we recommend making it very clear when the input stops to avoid the model trying to continue it. For example, the prompt ""Translate to English: Je t'aime"" without the full stop (.) at the end, may result in the model trying to continue the French sentence. Better prompts are e.g. ""Translate to English: Je t'aime."", ""Translate to English: Je t'aime. Translation:"" ""What is ""Je t'aime."" in English?"", where it is clear for the model when it should answer. Further, we recommend providing the model as much context as possible. For example, if you want it to answer in Telugu, then tell the model, e.g. ""Explain in a sentence in Telugu what is backpropagation in neural networks."".",natural-language-processing,text-generation,https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.01786.pdf,License: bigscience-bloom-rail-1.0,Datasets: bigscience/xP3,46 languages,PyTorch; TensorBoard; Safetensors; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 429,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 16899,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 224.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 68

distilbert-base-uncased,,,,,,,,,"This model is a distilled version of the BERT base model. It was
introduced in this paper. The code for the distillation process can be found
here. This model is uncased: it does
not make a difference between english and English.; DistilBERT is a transformers model, smaller and faster than BERT, which was pretrained on the same corpus in a
self-supervised fashion, using the BERT base model as a teacher. This means it was pretrained on the raw texts only,
with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of publicly available data) with an automatic
process to generate inputs and labels from those texts using the BERT base model. More precisely, it was pretrained
with three objectives:; This way, the model learns the same inner representation of the English language than its teacher model, while being
faster for inference or downstream tasks.; You can use the raw model for either masked language modeling or next sentence prediction, but it's mostly intended to
be fine-tuned on a downstream task. See the model hub to look for
fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.; Note that this model is primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on tasks that use the whole sentence (potentially masked)
to make decisions, such as sequence classification, token classification or question answering. For tasks such as text

Additionally, we performed human evaluation with the XSTS protocol and measured the toxicity of the generated translations.; ? We used parallel multilingual data from a variety of sources to train the model. We provide detailed report on data selection and construction process in Section 5 in the paper. We also used monolingual data constructed from Common Crawl. We provide more details in Section 5.2.; ? In this work, we took a reflexive approach in technological development to ensure that we prioritize human users and minimize risks that could be transferred to them. While we reflect on our ethical considerations throughout the article, here are some additional points to highlight. For one, many languages chosen for this study are low-resource languages, with a heavy emphasis on African languages. While quality translation could improve education and information access in many in these communities, such an access could also make groups with lower levels of digital literacy more vulnerable to misinformation or online scams. The latter scenarios could arise if bad actors misappropriate our work for nefarious activities, which we conceive as an example of unintended use. Regarding data acquisition, the training data used for model development were mined from various publicly available sources on the web. Although we invested heavily in data cleaning, personally identifiable information may not be entirely eliminated. Finally, although we did our best to optimize for translation quality, mistranslations produced by the model could remain. Although the odds are low, this could have adverse impact on those who rely on these translations to make important decisions (particularly when related to health and safety).",natural-language-processing,translation,https://huggingface.co/facebook/nllb-200-3.3B,,License: cc-by-nc-4.0,Datasets: flores-200,196 languages,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 82,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 51820,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 18.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 14

The SpeechT5 framework consists of a shared encoder-decoder network and six modal-specific (speech/text) pre/post-nets. After preprocessing the input speech/text through the pre-nets, the shared encoder-decoder network models the sequence-to-sequence transformation, and then the post-nets generate the output in the speech/text modality based on the output of the decoder.; Leveraging large-scale unlabeled speech and text data, we pre-train SpeechT5 to learn a unified-modal representation, hoping to improve the modeling capability for both speech and text.

was pretrained with two objectives:; This way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language used in tables and associated texts, which can then be used 
to extract features useful for downstream tasks such as answering questions about a table, or determining whether a sentence is entailed

Geneformer,,,,,,,,,"Geneformer is a foundation transformer model pretrained on a large-scale corpus of ~30 million single cell transcriptomes to enable context-aware predictions in settings with limited data in network biology. ; See our manuscript for details.; Geneformer is a foundation transformer model pretrained on Genecorpus-30M, a pretraining corpus comprised of ~30 million single cell transcriptomes from a broad range of human tissues. We excluded cells with high mutational burdens (e.g. malignant cells and immortalized cell lines) that could lead to substantial network rewiring without companion genome sequencing to facilitate interpretation. Each single cell¡¯s transcriptome is presented to the model as a rank value encoding where genes are ranked by their expression in that cell normalized by their expression across the entire Genecorpus-30M. The rank value encoding provides a nonparametric representation of that cell¡¯s transcriptome and takes advantage of the many observations of each gene¡¯s expression across Genecorpus-30M to prioritize genes that distinguish cell state. Specifically, this method will deprioritize ubiquitously highly-expressed housekeeping genes by normalizing them to a lower rank. Conversely, genes such as transcription factors that may be lowly expressed when they are expressed but highly distinguish cell state will move to a higher rank within the encoding. Furthermore, this rank-based approach may be more robust against technical artifacts that may systematically bias the absolute transcript counts value while the overall relative ranking of genes within each cell remains more stable. ; The rank value encoding of each single cell¡¯s transcriptome then proceeds through six transformer encoder units. Pretraining was accomplished using a masked learning objective where 15% of the genes within each transcriptome were masked and the model was trained to predict which gene should be within each masked position in that specific cell state using the context of the remaining unmasked genes. A major strength of this approach is that it is entirely self-supervised and can be accomplished on completely unlabeled data, which allows the inclusion of large amounts of training data without being restricted to samples with accompanying labels.; We detail applications and results in our manuscript.

biogpt,,,,,,,,,"Pre-trained language models have attracted increasing attention in the biomedical domain, inspired by their great success in the general natural language domain. Among the two main branches of pre-trained language models in the general language domain, i.e. BERT (and its variants) and GPT (and its variants), the first one has been extensively studied in the biomedical domain, such as BioBERT and PubMedBERT. While they have achieved great success on a variety of discriminative downstream biomedical tasks, the lack of generation ability constrains their application scope. In this paper, we propose BioGPT, a domain-specific generative Transformer language model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical literature.

BioGPT-Large-PubMedQA,,,,,,,,,"Pre-trained language models have attracted increasing attention in the biomedical domain, inspired by their great success in the general natural language domain. Among the two main branches of pre-trained language models in the general language domain, i.e. BERT (and its variants) and GPT (and its variants), the first one has been extensively studied in the biomedical domain, such as BioBERT and PubMedBERT. While they have achieved great success on a variety of discriminative downstream biomedical tasks, the lack of generation ability constrains their application scope. In this paper, we propose BioGPT, a domain-specific generative Transformer language model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical literature. We evaluate BioGPT on six biomedical natural language processing tasks and demonstrate that our model outperforms previous models on most tasks. Especially, we get 44.98%, 38.42% and 40.76% F1 score on BC5CDR, KD-DTI and DDI end-to-end relation extraction tasks, respectively, and 78.2% accuracy on PubMedQA, creating a new record. Our case study on text generation further demonstrates the advantage of BioGPT on biomedical literature to generate fluent descriptions for biomedical terms.; If you find BioGPT useful in your research, please cite the following paper:",natural-language-processing,text-generation,https://huggingface.co/microsoft/BioGPT-Large-PubMedQA,,License: mit,Datasets: pubmed_qa,English,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 60,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 1525,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 6.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 16

mpt-30b,,,,,,,,,"MPT-30B is a decoder-style transformer pretrained from scratch on 1T tokens of English text and code.
This model was trained by MosaicML.; MPT-30B is part of the family of Mosaic Pretrained Transformer (MPT) models, which use a modified transformer architecture optimized for efficient training and inference.; MPT-30B comes with special features that differentiate it from other LLMs, including an 8k token context window (which can be further extended via finetuning; see MPT-7B-StoryWriter), support for context-length extrapolation via ALiBi, and efficient inference + training via FlashAttention.

codet5p-110m-embedding,,,,,,,,,"CodeT5+ is a new family of open code large language models
with an encoder-decoder architecture that can flexibly operate in different modes (i.e. encoder-only, decoder-only,
and encoder-decoder) to support a wide range of code understanding and generation tasks.
It is introduced in the paper:; CodeT5+: Open Code Large Language Models for Code Understanding and Generation
by Yue Wang*, Hung Le*, Akhilesh Deepak Gotmare, Nghi D.Q. Bui, Junnan Li, Steven C.H. Hoi (*
indicates equal contribution).; Compared to the original CodeT5 family (base: 220M, large: 770M), CodeT5+ is pretrained with a diverse set of
pretraining tasks including span denoising, causal language modeling, contrastive learning, and text-code
matching to learn rich representations from both unimodal code data and bimodal code-text data.
Additionally, it employs a simple yet effective compute-efficient pretraining method to initialize the model
components with frozen off-the-shelf LLMs such as CodeGen to efficiently scale
up the model (i.e. 2B, 6B, 16B), and adopts a ""shallow encoder and deep decoder"" architecture.
Furthermore, it is instruction-tuned to align with natural language instructions (see our InstructCodeT5+ 16B)
following Code Alpaca.; This checkpoint consists of an encoder of CodeT5+ 220M model (pretrained from 2 stages on both unimodal and bimodal) and a projection layer, which can be used to extract code
embeddings of 256 dimension. It can be easily loaded using the AutoModel functionality and employs the
same CodeT5 tokenizer.; This checkpoint is trained on the stricter permissive subset of the deduplicated version of
the github-code dataset.
The data is preprocessed by reserving only permissively licensed code (""mit"" ¡°apache-2¡±, ¡°bsd-3-clause¡±, ¡°bsd-2-clause¡±,
¡°cc0-1.0¡±, ¡°unlicense¡±, ¡°isc¡±).

In addition there are several models that were trained on datasets with different filter parameters and with architecture and objective variations. ; The final model is the best performing model and was trained twice as long (236B tokens) as the others. This checkpoint is the default model and available on the main branch. All other checkpoints are on separate branches with according names.; The model was trained on GitHub code. As such it is not an instruction model and commands like ""Write a function that computes the square root."" do not work well.
You should phrase commands like they occur in source code such as comments (e.g. # the following function computes the sqrt) or write a function signature and docstring and let the model complete the function body.",natural-language-processing,text-generation,https://huggingface.co/bigcode/santacoder,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02150.pdf; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.14255.pdf; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.03988.pdf,License: bigcode-openrail-m,Datasets: bigcode/the-stack,code,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 280,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 16301,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 5.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 39

StreetCLIP,,,,,,,,,"StreetCLIP is a robust foundation model for open-domain image geolocalization and other
geographic and climate-related tasks.; Trained on an original dataset of 1.1 million street-level urban and rural geo-tagged images, it achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple open-domain image geolocalization benchmarks in zero-shot, 
outperforming supervised models trained on millions of images.; StreetCLIP is a model pretrained by deriving image captions synthetically from image class labels using
a domain-specific caption template. This allows StreetCLIP to transfer its generalized zero-shot learning
capabilities to a specific domain (i.e. the domain of image geolocalization). 
StreetCLIP builds on the OpenAI's pretrained large version of CLIP ViT, using 14x14 pixel
patches and images with a 336 pixel side length.; StreetCLIP has a deep understanding of the visual features found in street-level urban and rural scenes
and knows how to relate these concepts to specific countries, regions, and cities. Given its training setup,
the following use cases are recommended for StreetCLIP.; StreetCLIP can be used out-of-the box using zero-shot learning to infer the geolocation of images on a country, region,
or city level. Given that StreetCLIP was pretrained on a dataset of street-level urban and rural images,
the best performance can be expected on images from a similar distribution.",computer-vision,zero-shot-image-classification,https://huggingface.co/geolocal/StreetCLIP,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.00275.pdf,License: cc-by-nc-4.0,,English,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 12,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 2114,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 2.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 2

ControlNet-Models-For-Core-ML,,,,,,,,,"All of the models in this repo work with Swift and the apple/ml-stable-diffusion pipeline (release 0.4.0 or 1.0.0).  They were not built for, and will not work with, a Python Diffusers pipeline.  They need ml-stable-diffusion for command line use, or a Swift app that supports ControlNet, such as the (June 2023) MOCHI DIFFUSION 4.0 version.; The ControlNet models in this repo have both ""Original"" and ""Split-Einsum"" versions, all built for SD-1.5 type models.  They will not work with SD-2.1 type models.  The smaller zip files, with ""SE"", each have a single model for ""Split-Einsum"".  The larger zip files, without ""SE"", each have a set of ""Original"" models at 4 different resolutions. ; The ControlNet model files are in the ""CN"" folder of this repo.  They are zipped and need to be unzipped after downloading.  The larger zips hold ""Original"" types at 512x512, 512x768, 768x512 and 768x768.  The smaller zips with ""SE"" have a single model for ""Split-Einsum"".; If you are using a GUI like MOCHI DIFFUSION  4.0, the app will most likely guide you to the correct location/arrangement for your ConrolNet model folder.; Please note that when you unzip the ""Originl"" ControlNet files (for example Canny.zip) from this repo, they will unzip into a folder, with the actual four model files inside that folder.  This folder is just a holding folder for the zipping process.  What you want to move into your ControlNet model folder in Mochi Diffusion will be the individual files, not the folder they unzip into.  The ""Split-Einsum"" zips just have a single file and don't use a holding folder.  To make things even more confusing, on some Mac systems, an individual ControlNet model file, for example Canny-5x5.mlmodelc, will appear in Finder as a folder, not a file.  You want to move the Canny-5x5.mlmodelc file or folder (and other .mlmodelc files or folders) into your ControlNet store folder.  Don't move the plain ""Canny"" folder.  This is different from base models, where you do want to be moving the folder that the downloaded zip file unzips into.  See the images here and here for an example of how my folders are set up for Mochi Diffusion.",multimodel,text-to-image,https://huggingface.co/coreml/ControlNet-Models-For-Core-ML,,License: creativeml-openrail-m,,,Core ML,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 32,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 0,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 8.7KB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 0

musicgen-small,,,,,,,,,"MusicGen is a text-to-music model capable of genreating high-quality music samples conditioned on text descriptions or audio prompts.
It is a single stage auto-regressive Transformer model trained over a 32kHz EnCodec tokenizer with 4 codebooks sampled at 50 Hz. 
Unlike existing methods, like MusicLM, MusicGen doesn't require a self-supervised semantic representation, and it generates all 4 codebooks in one pass. 
By introducing a small delay between the codebooks, we show we can predict them in parallel, thus having only 50 auto-regressive steps per second of audio.; MusicGen was published in Simple and Controllable Music Generation by Jade Copet, Felix Kreuk, Itai Gat, Tal Remez, David Kant, Gabriel Synnaeve, Yossi Adi, Alexandre D¨¦fossez.; Four checkpoints are released:; Try out MusicGen yourself!; You can run MusicGen locally with the ?

It was introduced to show that multilingual translation models can be created through multilingual fine-tuning. 
Instead of fine-tuning on one direction, a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on many directions simultaneously. mBART-50 is created using the original mBART model and extended to add extra 25 languages to support multilingual machine translation models of 50 languages. The pre-training objective is explained below.; Multilingual Denoising Pretraining: The model incorporates N languages by concatenating data: 
D = {D1, ..., DN } where each Di is a collection of monolingual documents in language i. The source documents are noised using two schemes, 
first randomly shuffling the original sentences' order, and second a novel in-filling scheme, 
where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. The model is then tasked to reconstruct the original text. 
35% of each instance's words are masked by random sampling a span length according to a Poisson distribution (¦Ë = 3.5).
The decoder input is the original text with one position offset. A language id symbol LID is used as the initial token to predict the sentence.; mbart-large-50 is pre-trained model and primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on translation tasks. It can also be fine-tuned on other multilingual sequence-to-sequence tasks. 
See the model hub to look for fine-tuned versions.; As the model is multilingual, it expects the sequences in a different format. A special language id token is used as a prefix in both the source and target text. The text format is [lang_code] X [eos] with X being the source or target text respectively and lang_code is source_lang_code for source text and tgt_lang_code for target text. bos is never used.

One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds absolute position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder.; Note that this model does not provide any fine-tuned heads, as these were zero'd by Google researchers. However, the model does include the pre-trained pooler, which can be used for downstream tasks (such as image classification).",multimodel,feature-extraction,https://huggingface.co/google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03677.pdf,License: apache-2.0,Datasets: imagenet-21k,,PyTorch; TensorFlow; JAX; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 57,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 506670,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 1.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 46

You can load your data to a Google Drive and run the script for free on a Colab GPU. Set-up only takes a few minutes.

If you are looking for the model to use with the original CompVis Stable Diffusion codebase, come here. ; You can integrate this fine-tuned VAE decoder to your existing diffusers workflows, by including a vae argument to the StableDiffusionPipeline; We publish two kl-f8 autoencoder versions, finetuned from the original kl-f8 autoencoder on a 1:1 ratio of LAION-Aesthetics and LAION-Humans, an unreleased subset containing only SFW images of humans. The intent was to fine-tune on the Stable Diffusion training set (the autoencoder was originally trained on OpenImages) but also enrich the dataset with images of humans to improve the reconstruction of faces.
The first, ft-EMA, was resumed from the original checkpoint, trained for 313198 steps and uses EMA weights. It uses the same loss configuration as the original checkpoint (L1 + LPIPS).
The second, ft-MSE, was resumed from ft-EMA and uses EMA weights and was trained for another 280k steps using a different loss, with more emphasis 
on MSE reconstruction (MSE + 0.1 * LPIPS). It produces somewhat ``smoother'' outputs. The batch size for both versions was 192 (16 A100s, batch size 12 per GPU).

GODEL-v1_1-base-seq2seq,,,,,,,,,"GODEL is a large-scale pre-trained model for goal-directed dialogs. It is parameterized with a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model and trained for response generation grounded in external text, which allows more effective fine-tuning on dialog tasks that require conditioning the response on information that is external to the current conversation (e.g., a retrieved document). The pre-trained model can be efficiently fine-tuned and adapted to accomplish a new dialog task with a handful of task-specific dialogs. The v1.1 model is trained on 551M multi-turn dialogs from Reddit discussion thread, and 5M instruction and knowledge grounded dialogs.; Chitchat example:; Instruction: given a dialog context, you need to response empathically.

blip-image-captioning-base,,,,,,,,,"Model card for image captioning pretrained on COCO dataset - base architecture (with ViT base backbone).; Authors from the paper write in the abstract:; Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) has advanced the performance for many vision-language tasks. However, most existing pre-trained models only excel in either understanding-based tasks or generation-based tasks. Furthermore, performance improvement has been largely achieved by scaling up the dataset with noisy image-text pairs collected from the web, which is a suboptimal source of supervision. In this paper, we propose BLIP, a new VLP framework which transfers flexibly to both vision-language understanding and generation tasks. BLIP effectively utilizes the noisy web data by bootstrapping the captions, where a captioner generates synthetic captions and a filter removes the noisy ones. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of vision-language tasks, such as image-text retrieval (+2.7% in average recall@1), image captioning (+2.8% in CIDEr), and VQA (+1.6% in VQA score). BLIP also demonstrates strong generalization ability when directly transferred to videolanguage tasks in a zero-shot manner. Code, models, and datasets are released.; You can use this model for conditional and un-conditional image captioning",multimodel,image-to-text,https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12086.pdf,License: bsd-3-clause,,,PyTorch; TensorFlow; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 157,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 446902,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 2.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 260

source of pretraining data well suited to the diversity of downstream tasks. Intuitively, this objective subsumes common pretraining signals such as OCR, language modeling, image captioning. In addition to the novel pretraining strategy,
we introduce a variable-resolution input representation and a more flexible integration of language and vision inputs, where language prompts such as questions
are rendered directly on top of the input image. For the first time, we show that a
single pretrained model can achieve state-of-the-art results in six out of nine tasks

deplot,,,,,,,,,"; The abstract of the paper states that: ; Visual language such as charts and plots is ubiquitous in the human world. Comprehending plots and charts requires strong reasoning skills. Prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) models require at least tens of thousands of training examples and their reasoning capabilities are still much limited, especially on complex human-written queries. This paper presents the first one-shot solution to visual language reasoning. We decompose the challenge of visual language reasoning into two steps: (1) plot-to-text translation, and (2) reasoning over the translated text. The key in this method is a modality conversion module, named as DePlot, which translates the image of a plot or chart to a linearized table. The output of DePlot can then be directly used to prompt a pretrained large language model (LLM), exploiting the few-shot reasoning capabilities of LLMs. To obtain DePlot, we standardize the plot-to-table task by establishing unified task formats and metrics, and train DePlot end-to-end on this task. DePlot can then be used off-the-shelf together with LLMs in a plug-and-play fashion. Compared with a SOTA model finetuned on more than >28k data points, DePlot+LLM with just one-shot prompting achieves a 24.0% improvement over finetuned SOTA on human-written queries from the task of chart QA.; You can run a prediction by querying an input image together with a question as follows:; You can use the convert_pix2struct_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py script as follows:",multimodel,visual-question-answering,https://huggingface.co/google/deplot,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10505.pdf,License: apache-2.0,,5 languages,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 48,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 7488,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 1.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 6

Quantized GGML may have some minimal loss of model quality.; The Wizard Mega 13B SFT model is being released after two epochs as the eval loss increased during the 3rd (final planned epoch).

medguanaco-lora-65b-GPTQ,,,,,,,,,"Model Description ; nmitchko/medguanaco-lora-65b-GPTQ is a large language model specifically fine-tuned for medical domain tasks.
It is based on the Guanaco LORA of LLaMA weighing in at 65B parameters. 
The primary goal of this model is to improve question-answering and medical dialogue tasks.
It was trained using LoRA and quantized, to reduce memory footprint. ; Steps to load this model:; The following README is taken from the source page medalpaca; The training data for this project was sourced from various resources. 
Firstly, we used Anki flashcards to automatically generate questions, 
from the front of the cards and anwers from the back of the card. 
Secondly, we generated medical question-answer pairs from Wikidoc. 
We extracted paragraphs with relevant headings, and used Chat-GPT 3.5 
to generate questions from the headings and using the corresponding paragraphs 
as answers. This dataset is still under development and we believe 
that approximately 70% of these question answer pairs are factual correct. 
Thirdly, we used StackExchange to extract question-answer pairs, taking the 
top-rated question from five categories: Academia, Bioinformatics, Biology, 
Fitness, and Health. Additionally, we used a dataset from ChatDoctor 
consisting of 200,000 question-answer pairs, available at https://github.com/Kent0n-Li/ChatDoctor.",natural-language-processing,text-generation,https://huggingface.co/nmitchko/medguanaco-lora-65b-GPTQ,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.14070.pdf,License: cc,,English,Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 8,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 0,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 336.0MB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 0

controlnet_qrcode-control_v11p_sd21,,,,,,,,,"; This repo holds the safetensors & diffusers versions of the QR code conditioned ControlNet for Stable Diffusion v2.1.
The Stable Diffusion 2.1 version is marginally more effective, as it was developed to address my specific needs. However, a 1.5 version model was also trained on the same dataset for those who are using the older version.; These models perform quite well in most cases, but please note that they are not 100% accurate. In some instances, the QR code shape might not come through as expected. You can increase the ControlNet weight to emphasize the QR code shape. However, be cautious as this might negatively impact the style of your output.To optimize for scanning, please generate your QR codes with correction mode 'H' (30%).; To balance between style and shape, a gentle fine-tuning of the control weight might be required based on the individual input and the desired output, aswell as the correct prompt. Some prompts do not work until you increase the weight by a lot. The process of finding the right balance between these factors is part art and part science. For the best results, it is recommended to generate your artwork at a resolution of 768. This allows for a higher level of detail in the final product, enhancing the quality and effectiveness of the QR code-based artwork.; The simplest way to use this is to place the .safetensors model and its .yaml config file in the folder where your other controlnet models are installed, which varies per application. 
For usage in auto1111 they can be placed in the webui/models/ControlNet folder. They can be loaded using the controlnet webui extension which you can install through the extensions tab in the webui (https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet). Make sure to enable your controlnet unit and set your input image as the QR code. Set the model to either the SD2.1 or 1.5 version depending on your base stable diffusion model, or it will error. No pre-processor is needed, though you can use the invert pre-processor for a different variation of results. 768 is the preferred resolution for generation since it allows for more detail.
Make sure to look up additional info on how to use controlnet if you get stuck, once you have the webui up and running its really easy to install the controlnet extension aswell.",computer-vision,image-to-image,https://huggingface.co/DionTimmer/controlnet_qrcode-control_v11p_sd21,,License: openrail++,,English,Diffusers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 34,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 5975,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 6.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 6

They provide a separate model card here.; The abstract of the Shap-E paper:; We present Shap-E, a conditional generative model for 3D assets. Unlike recent work on 3D generative models which produce a single output representation, Shap-E directly generates the parameters of implicit functions that can be rendered as both textured meshes and neural radiance fields. We train Shap-E in two stages: first, we train an encoder that deterministically maps 3D assets into the parameters of an implicit function; second, we train a conditional diffusion model on outputs of the encoder. When trained on a large dataset of paired 3D and text data, our resulting models are capable of generating complex and diverse 3D assets in a matter of seconds. When compared to Point-E, an explicit generative model over point clouds, Shap-E converges faster and reaches comparable or better sample quality despite modeling a higher-dimensional, multi-representation output space.

WizardCoder-Guanaco-15B-V1.1,,,,,,,,,"The WizardCoder-Guanaco-15B-V1.1 is a language model that combines the strengths of the WizardCoder base model and the openassistant-guanaco dataset for finetuning. The openassistant-guanaco dataset was further trimmed to within 2 standard deviations of token size for input and output pairs and all non-english data has been removed to reduce training size requirements.; Version 1.1 showcases notable enhancements, employing a modified version of the previous openassistant-guanaco dataset. This dataset underwent a comprehensive revision, replacing every single answer with those generated by GPT-4.; The volume of the datasets has also been augmented by approximately 50%, with a particular focus on high school and abstract algebra. This expansion leveraged the combined capabilities of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo. The initial evaluation of algebraic functions over 12 epochs indicated promising results from this enriched dataset. However, this is just the beginning; further refinements are in the pipeline, aiming to optimize the dataset quality and subsequently decrease the number of epochs required to achieve comparable results.; Considering the need to curtail memory consumption during training, this dataset was tailored to consist solely of English language questions and answers. Consequently, the model's performance in language translation may not be up to par. Nevertheless, the focus remains on enhancing the model's proficiency and efficiency within its defined scope.; This model is designed to be used for a wide array of text generation tasks that require understanding and generating English text. The model is expected to perform well in tasks such as answering questions, writing essays, summarizing text, translation, and more. However, given the specific data processing and finetuning done, it might be particularly effective for tasks related to English language question-answering systems.",natural-language-processing,text-generation,https://huggingface.co/LoupGarou/WizardCoder-Guanaco-15B-V1.1,,License: apache-2.0,Datasets: guanaco,English,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 3,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 73,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 31.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 0

Two heads are added on top of the decoder outputs in order to perform object detection: a linear layer for the class labels and a MLP (multi-layer perceptron) for the bounding boxes. The model uses so-called object queries to detect objects in an image. Each object query looks for a particular object in the image. For COCO, the number of object queries is set to 100. ; The model is trained using a ""bipartite matching loss"": one compares the predicted classes + bounding boxes of each of the N = 100 object queries to the ground truth annotations, padded up to the same length N (so if an image only contains 4 objects, 96 annotations will just have a ""no object"" as class and ""no bounding box"" as bounding box). The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to create an optimal one-to-one mapping between each of the N queries and each of the N annotations. Next, standard cross-entropy (for the classes) and a linear combination of the L1 and generalized IoU loss (for the bounding boxes) are used to optimize the parameters of the model.; ",computer-vision,object-detection,https://huggingface.co/facebook/detr-resnet-50,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12872.pdf,License: apache-2.0,Datasets: coco,,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 200,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 650109,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 167.0MB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 54

Community week using JAX/Flax for NLP & CV, 
organized by Hugging Face. We developped this model as part of the project:

as intervention from Google¡¯s Flax, JAX, and Cloud team member about efficient deep learning frameworks.; Our model is intented to be used as a sentence encoder. Given an input sentence, it ouptuts a vector which captures 
the sentence semantic information. The sentence vector may be used for information retrieval, clustering or sentence 
similarity tasks.; Here is how to use this model to get the features of a given text using SentenceTransformers library:; We use the pretrained 'MiniLM-L6-H384-uncased' which is a 6 layer version of

The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts every language problem into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled datasets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks.

Natural language processing stands to help address these issues by automatically defining unfamiliar terms. We introduce a new task and dataset for defining scientific terms and controlling the complexity of gen- erated definitions as a way of adapting to a specific reader¡¯s background knowledge. We test four definition generation methods for this new task, finding that a sequence-to-sequence approach is most successful. We then explore the version of the task in which definitions are generated at a target complexity level. We in- troduce a novel reranking approach and find in human evaluations that it offers superior fluency while also controlling complexity, compared to several controllable generation baselines.; The model is finetuned on the task of generating definitions of scientific terms. We frame our task as generating an answer to the question ¡°What is (are) X?¡± Along with the question, the model takes a support document of scientific abstracted related to the term being defined.

to 175B parameters, which we aim to fully and responsibly share with interested researchers. We train the OPT models to roughly match 
the performance and sizes of the GPT-3 class of models, while also applying the latest best practices in data
collection and efficient training. Our aim in developing this suite of OPT models is to enable reproducible and responsible research at scale, and
to bring more voices to the table in studying the impact of these LLMs. Definitions of risk, harm, bias, and toxicity, etc., should be articulated by the
collective research community as a whole, which is only possible when models are available for study.",natural-language-processing,text-generation,https://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-1.3b,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.01068.pdf; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf,License: other,,English,PyTorch; TensorFlow; JAX; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 98,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 125507,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 8.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 49

The metric used is accuracy.
The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on each dataset. Surprisingly, it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on ANLI (ALBERT-XXL) by 8,3%.

nllb-200-distilled-1.3B,,,,,,,,,"This is the model card of NLLB-200's distilled 1.3B variant.; Here are the metrics for that particular checkpoint.; ? Model performance measures: NLLB-200 model was evaluated using BLEU, spBLEU, and chrF++ metrics widely adopted by machine translation community. Additionally, we performed human evaluation with the XSTS protocol and measured the toxicity of the generated translations.; ? We used parallel multilingual data from a variety of sources to train the model. We provide detailed report on data selection and construction process in Section 5 in the paper. We also used monolingual data constructed from Common Crawl. We provide more details in Section 5.2.; ? In this work, we took a reflexive approach in technological development to ensure that we prioritize human users and minimize risks that could be transferred to them. While we reflect on our ethical considerations throughout the article, here are some additional points to highlight. For one, many languages chosen for this study are low-resource languages, with a heavy emphasis on African languages. While quality translation could improve education and information access in many in these communities, such an access could also make groups with lower levels of digital literacy more vulnerable to misinformation or online scams. The latter scenarios could arise if bad actors misappropriate our work for nefarious activities, which we conceive as an example of unintended use. Regarding data acquisition, the training data used for model development were mined from various publicly available sources on the web. Although we invested heavily in data cleaning, personally identifiable information may not be entirely eliminated. Finally, although we did our best to optimize for translation quality, mistranslations produced by the model could remain. Although the odds are low, this could have adverse impact on those who rely on these translations to make important decisions (particularly when related to health and safety).",natural-language-processing,translation,https://huggingface.co/facebook/nllb-200-distilled-1.3B,,License: cc-by-nc-4.0,Datasets: flores-200,196 languages,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 44,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 40925,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 6.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 20

For BLOOMZ models, we recommend making it very clear when the input stops to avoid the model trying to continue it.

Better prompts are e.g. ""Translate to English: Je t'aime."", ""Translate to English: Je t'aime. Translation:"" ""What is ""Je t'aime."" in English?"", where it is clear for the model when it should answer. Further, we recommend providing the model as much context as possible.

ldm-super-resolution-4x-openimages,,,,,,,,,"Paper: High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models; Abstract:; By decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application of denoising autoencoders, diffusion models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results on image data and beyond. Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve a new state of the art for image inpainting and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, semantic scene synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs.; Authors; Robin Rombach, Andreas Blattmann, Dominik Lorenz, Patrick Esser, Bj?rn Ommer",,,https://huggingface.co/CompVis/ldm-super-resolution-4x-openimages,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.10752.pdf,License: apache-2.0,,,Diffusers; PyTorch,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 60,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 4595,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 4.55KB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 1

scientific_abstract_simplification,,,,,,,,,"Scientific Abstract Simplification (SAS) is a tool designed to rewrite complex scientific abstracts into simpler, more comprehensible versions. Our objective is to make scientific knowledge universally accessible. If you have already experimented with our baseline model (sas_baseline), you will find that the current model surpasses its predecessor in terms of all evaluation metrics. Feel free to test it via the Hosted Inference API to your right. Simply select one of the provided examples or input your own scientific abstract. Just ensure to precede your text with the instruction, ""summarize, simplify, and contextualize: "", followed by a space. For local usage, refer to the Usage section.""; Open science has significantly reduced barriers to accessing scientific papers.
However, attainable research does not entail accessible knowledge.
Consequently, many individuals might prefer to rely on succinct social media narratives rather than endeavour to comprehend a scientific paper.
This preference is understandable as humans often favor narratives over dry, technical information. 
So, why not ""translate"" these intricate scientific abstracts into simpler, more accessible narratives? 
Several prestigious journals have already initiated steps towards enhancing accessibility. 
For instance, PNAS requires authors to submit Significance Statements understandable to an 'undergraduate-educated scientist', while Science includes an editor's abstract to provide a swift overview of the paper's salient points.; In this project, our objective is to employ AI to rewrite scientific abstracts into easily understandable scientific narratives.
To facilitate this, we have curated two new datasets: one containing PNAS abstract-significance pairs and the other encapsulating editor abstracts from Science.
We utilize a Transformer model (a variant known as Flan-T5) to fine-tune our model for the task of simplifying scientific abstracts.
Initially, the model is fine-tuned utilizing multiple discrete instructions by amalgamating four pertinent tasks in a challenge-proportional manner (a strategy we refer to as Multi-Instruction Pretuning).
Subsequently, we continue the fine-tuning process exclusively with the abstract-significance corpus. Our model can generate lay summaries that outperform models fine-tuned solely with the abstract-significance corpus and models fine-tuned with traditional task combinations.
We hope our work can foster a more comprehensive understanding of scientific research, enabling a larger audience to benefit from open science.; Use the code below to get started with the model. Remember to prepend the INSTRUCTION for best performance.; We finetuned the base model (flan-t5-large) on multiple relevant tasks with standard language modeling loss. During training, the source text of each task is prepended with an task-specific instruction and mapped to the corresponding target text. For example, ""simplify: "" is added before a wiki text, and the whole text is fed into the model to line up with the corresponding simple wiki text.

SkyPaint,,,,,,,,,"SkyPaint is a Chinese-English bilingual text-generated image project developed by Singularity-AI. It is still being updated and optimized.; The SkyPaint text generation image model is mainly composed of two parts, namely the prompt word text encoder model and the diffusion model. Therefore, our optimization is also divided into two steps. First, based on OpenAI-CLIP, we optimized the prompt word text encoder model to make SkyPaint have the ability to recognize Chinese and English, and then optimized the diffusion model, so that SkyPaint has modern artistic capabilities and can produce high-quality pictures.; Chinese and English mixed prompt word input.

Introduction to SkyCLIP Models
SkyCLIP is a CLIP model obtained by using an efficient method of training Chinese-English bilingual CLIP models. This method only needs to use text data to achieve efficient distillation of the OpenAI-CLIP model, which greatly reduces the data threshold. At the same time, training requires Compared with the original CLIP model, the computing power requirement is reduced by more than 90%, which is convenient for the open source community to reproduce/fine-tune. This method only changes the text encoder of OpenAI-CLIP, and can be used with the image encoder of OpenAI-CLIP to realize the image-text retrieval function.; »úÐµ¹·

BioGPT-Large,,,,,,,,,"Pre-trained language models have attracted increasing attention in the biomedical domain, inspired by their great success in the general natural language domain. Among the two main branches of pre-trained language models in the general language domain, i.e. BERT (and its variants) and GPT (and its variants), the first one has been extensively studied in the biomedical domain, such as BioBERT and PubMedBERT. While they have achieved great success on a variety of discriminative downstream biomedical tasks, the lack of generation ability constrains their application scope. In this paper, we propose BioGPT, a domain-specific generative Transformer language model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical literature. We evaluate BioGPT on six biomedical natural language processing tasks and demonstrate that our model outperforms previous models on most tasks. Especially, we get 44.98%, 38.42% and 40.76% F1 score on BC5CDR, KD-DTI and DDI end-to-end relation extraction tasks, respectively, and 78.2% accuracy on PubMedQA, creating a new record. Our case study on text generation further demonstrates the advantage of BioGPT on biomedical literature to generate fluent descriptions for biomedical terms.; If you find BioGPT useful in your research, please cite the following paper:",natural-language-processing,text-generation,https://huggingface.co/microsoft/BioGPT-Large,,License: mit,Datasets: pubmed,English,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 109,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 5709,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 6.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 22

pythia-2.8b-deduped,,,,,,,,,"The Pythia Scaling Suite is a collection of models developed to facilitate 
interpretability research (see paper). 
It contains two sets of eight models of sizes 
70M, 160M, 410M, 1B, 1.4B, 2.8B, 6.9B, and 12B. For each size, there are two 
models: one trained on the Pile, and one trained on the Pile after the dataset 
has been globally deduplicated. All 8 model sizes are trained on the exact 
same data, in the exact same order. We also provide 154 intermediate 
checkpoints per model, hosted on Hugging Face as branches.; The Pythia model suite was designed to promote scientific 
research on large language models, especially interpretability research. 
Despite not centering downstream performance as a design goal, we find the 
models match or exceed the performance of 
similar and same-sized models, such as those in the OPT and GPT-Neo suites.; Previously, we released an early version of the Pythia suite to the public. 
However, we decided to retrain the model suite to address a few hyperparameter 
discrepancies. This model card lists the changes; 
see appendix B in the Pythia paper for further discussion. We found no 
difference in benchmark performance between the two Pythia versions. 
The old models are 
still available, but we 
suggest the retrained suite if you are just starting to use Pythia.
This is the current release.; Please note that all models in the Pythia suite were renamed in January 
2023. For clarity, a table 
comparing the old and new names is provided in this model card, together 
with exact parameter counts.; The primary intended use of Pythia is research on the behavior, functionality, 
and limitations of large language models. This suite is intended to provide 
a controlled setting for performing scientific experiments. We also provide 
154 checkpoints per model: initial step0, 10 log-spaced checkpoints 
step{1,2,4...512}, and 143 evenly-spaced checkpoints from step1000 to 
step143000. These checkpoints are hosted on Hugging Face as branches. Note 
that branch 143000 corresponds exactly to the model checkpoint on the main

boring_e621,,,,,,,,,"This embedding attempts to capture what it means for an image to be uninteresting.  It was trained as a negative embedding using e621 style tags as prompts during training.
If you're using the Automatic1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI, place the boring_e621_v4.pt file in 
stable-diffusion-webui\embeddings and add ""boring_e621_v4"" to your negative prompt for more interesting outputs.
; The motivation for boring_e621 is that negative embeddings like Bad Prompt, 
whose training is described here 
depend on manually curated lists of tags describing features people do not want their images to have, such as ""deformed hands"".  Some problems with this approach are:; To address these problems, boring_e621 employs textual inversion on a set of images automatically extracted from the art site 
e621.net, a rich resource of millions of hand-labeled artworks, each of which is both human-labeled topically and rated 
according to its quality.  E621.net allows users to express their approval of an artwork by either up-voting it, or marking it as a favorite.Boring_e621 was specifically trained on artworks automatically selected from the site according to the criteria 
that no user has ever Favorited or Up-Voted them.  boring_e621 thus learned to produce low-quality images, so when it is 
used in the negative prompt of a stable diffusion image generator, the model avoids making mistakes that would make the generation more boring.
; To qualitatively evaluate how well boring_e621 has learned to improve image quality, we apply it to 4 simple sample prompts using the base Stable Diffusion 1.5 model.; ",,,https://huggingface.co/FoodDesert/boring_e621,,License: apache-2.0,,,,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 38,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 0,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 153.0MB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 0

pythia-1b,,,,,,,,,"The Pythia Scaling Suite is a collection of models developed to facilitate 
interpretability research (see paper). 
It contains two sets of eight models of sizes 
70M, 160M, 410M, 1B, 1.4B, 2.8B, 6.9B, and 12B. For each size, there are two 
models: one trained on the Pile, and one trained on the Pile after the dataset 
has been globally deduplicated. All 8 model sizes are trained on the exact 
same data, in the exact same order. We also provide 154 intermediate 
checkpoints per model, hosted on Hugging Face as branches.; The Pythia model suite was deliberately designed to promote scientific 
research on large language models, especially interpretability research. 
Despite not centering downstream performance as a design goal, we find the 
models match or exceed the performance of 
similar and same-sized models, such as those in the OPT and GPT-Neo suites.; Previously, we released an early version of the Pythia suite to the public. 
However, we decided to retrain the model suite to address a few hyperparameter 
discrepancies. This model card lists the changes; 
see appendix B in the Pythia paper for further discussion. We found no 
difference in benchmark performance between the two Pythia versions. 
The old models are 
still available, but we 
suggest the retrained suite if you are just starting to use Pythia.
This is the current release.; Please note that all models in the Pythia suite were renamed in January 
2023. For clarity, a table 
comparing the old and new names is provided in this model card, together 
with exact parameter counts.; The primary intended use of Pythia is research on the behavior, functionality, 
and limitations of large language models. This suite is intended to provide 
a controlled setting for performing scientific experiments. We also provide 
154 checkpoints per model: initial step0, 10 log-spaced checkpoints 
step{1,2,4...512}, and 143 evenly-spaced checkpoints from step1000 to 
step143000. These checkpoints are hosted on Hugging Face as branches. Note 
that branch 143000 corresponds exactly to the model checkpoint on the main 
branch of each model.",natural-language-processing,text-generation,https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/pythia-1b,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01373.pdf; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00027.pdf; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.07311.pdf,License: apache-2.0,Datasets: the_pile,English,PyTorch; Safetensors; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 8,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 18283,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 4.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 0

pix2struct-ai2d-base,,,,,,,,,"; Pix2Struct is an image encoder - text decoder model that is trained on image-text pairs for various tasks, including image captionning and visual question answering. The full list of available models can be found on the Table 1 of the paper:; ; The abstract of the model states that: ; Visually-situated language is ubiquitous¡ªsources range from textbooks with diagrams to web pages with images and tables, to mobile apps with buttons and
forms. Perhaps due to this diversity, previous work has typically relied on domainspecific recipes with limited sharing of the underlying data, model architectures,
and objectives. We present Pix2Struct, a pretrained image-to-text model for
purely visual language understanding, which can be finetuned on tasks containing visually-situated language. Pix2Struct is pretrained by learning to parse
masked screenshots of web pages into simplified HTML. The web, with its richness of visual elements cleanly reflected in the HTML structure, provides a large
source of pretraining data well suited to the diversity of downstream tasks. Intuitively, this objective subsumes common pretraining signals such as OCR, language modeling, image captioning. In addition to the novel pretraining strategy,
we introduce a variable-resolution input representation and a more flexible integration of language and vision inputs, where language prompts such as questions
are rendered directly on top of the input image. For the first time, we show that a
single pretrained model can achieve state-of-the-art results in six out of nine tasks
across four domains: documents, illustrations, user interfaces, and natural images.",multimodel,visual-question-answering,https://huggingface.co/google/pix2struct-ai2d-base,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03347.pdf,License: apache-2.0,,5 languages,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 21,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 1126,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 569.0MB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 2

medalpaca-lora-30b-8bit,,,,,,,,,"Model Description ; medalpaca-lora-30b-8bit is a large language model specifically fine-tuned for medical domain tasks. 
It is based on LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) and contains 7 billion parameters. 
The primary goal of this model is to improve question-answering and medical dialogue tasks.
It was trained using LoRA and quantized, to reduce memory footprint. ; The training data for this project was sourced from various resources. 
Firstly, we used Anki flashcards to automatically generate questions, 
from the front of the cards and anwers from the back of the card. 
Secondly, we generated medical question-answer pairs from Wikidoc. 
We extracted paragraphs with relevant headings, and used Chat-GPT 3.5 
to generate questions from the headings and using the corresponding paragraphs 
as answers. This dataset is still under development and we believe 
that approximately 70% of these question answer pairs are factual correct. 
Thirdly, we used StackExchange to extract question-answer pairs, taking the 
top-rated question from five categories: Academia, Bioinformatics, Biology, 
Fitness, and Health. Additionally, we used a dataset from ChatDoctor 
consisting of 200,000 question-answer pairs, available at https://github.com/Kent0n-Li/ChatDoctor.; The model may not perform effectively outside the scope of the medical domain.
The training data primarily targets the knowledge level of medical students, 
which may result in limitations when addressing the needs of board-certified physicians.
The model has not been tested in real-world applications, so its efficacy and accuracy are currently unknown.

The 001 was designed as a naive test to determine whether it is possible to create an german instruction-tuned model using a small, undertrained LLM and a naive translated dataset. The goal of this test was to explore the potential of the BLOOM architecture for language modeling tasks that require instruction-based responses.; To achieve this goal, we used a pre-trained LLM model with limited training, and fine-tuned it using a dataset of naive translations of instruction-based content. The dataset was created by taking instructions in English and translating them into German using an automated translation tool. While this approach may introduce errors in the translated content, we wanted to test whether the model could still learn to generate instruction-based responses in a variety of languages.; instruct-igel-001 is trained on naive translated instruction datasets, without much post-processing.

However, state-of-the-art visionlanguage models do not perform well on these data. We propose MATCHA (Math reasoning and Chart derendering pretraining) to enhance visual language models¡¯ capabilities jointly modeling charts/plots and language data. Specifically we propose several pretraining tasks that cover plot deconstruction and numerical reasoning which are the key capabilities in visual language modeling. We perform the MATCHA pretraining starting from Pix2Struct, a recently proposed imageto-text visual language model. On standard benchmarks such as PlotQA and ChartQA, MATCHA model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by as much as nearly 20%. We also examine how well MATCHA pretraining transfers to domains such as screenshot, textbook diagrams, and document figures and observe overall improvement, verifying the usefulness of MATCHA pretraining on broader visual language tasks.; You should ask specific questions to the model in order to get consistent generations.

It is introduced in the paper:; CodeT5+: Open Code Large Language Models for Code Understanding and Generation
by Yue Wang*, Hung Le*, Akhilesh Deepak Gotmare, Nghi D.Q. Bui, Junnan Li, Steven C.H. Hoi (* indicates equal contribution).; Compared to the original CodeT5 family (base: 220M, large: 770M), CodeT5+ is pretrained with a diverse set of pretraining tasks including span denoising, causal language modeling, contrastive learning, and text-code matching to learn rich representations from both unimodal code data and bimodal code-text data. 
Additionally, it employs a simple yet effective compute-efficient pretraining method to initialize the model components with frozen off-the-shelf LLMs such as CodeGen to efficiently scale up the model (i.e. 2B, 6B, 16B), and adopts a ""shallow encoder and deep decoder"" architecture. 
Furthermore, it is instruction-tuned to align with natural language instructions (see our InstructCodeT5+ 16B) following Code Alpaca.  ; This model can be easily loaded using the AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM functionality and employs the same tokenizer as CodeGen.; This checkpoint is trained on the stricter permissive subset of the deduplicated version of the github-code dataset.

InstructUIE,,,,,,,,,"https://github.com/BeyonderXX/InstructUIE; Large language models have unlocked strong multi-task capabilities from reading instructive prompts.
However, recent studies have shown that existing large models still have difficulty with information extraction tasks. 
For example, gpt-3.5-turbo achieved an F1 score of 18.22 on the Ontonotes dataset, which is significantly lower than the state-of-the-art performance.
In this paper, we propose InstructUIE, a unified information extraction framework based on instruction tuning, which can uniformly model various information extraction tasks and capture the inter-task dependency.
To validate the proposed method, we introduce IE INSTRUCTIONS, a benchmark of 32 diverse information extraction datasets in a unified text-to-text format with expert-written instructions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to Bert in supervised settings and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art and gpt3.5 in zero-shot settings.; Our models are trained and evaluated on IE INSTRUCTIONS. 
You can download the data from Baidu NetDisk or Google Drive.; If you are using InstructUIE for your work, please kindly cite our paper:",natural-language-processing,text2text-generation,https://huggingface.co/ZWK/InstructUIE,,License: openrail,,,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 3,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 161,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 45.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 0

BigTranslate,,,,,,,,,"Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate promising translation performance among various natural languages. However, many LLMs especially the open-sourced ones, such as BLOOM and LLaMA, are English-dominant and support only dozens of natural languages, making the potential of LLMs on language translation less explored. In this work, we present BigTranslate which adapts LLaMA that covers only 20 languages and enhances it with multilingual translation capability on more than 100 languages. BigTranslate is built upon LLaMA-13B and it is optimized in three steps. First, we continue training LLaMA with massive Chinese monolingual data. Second, we continue training the model with a large-scale parallel dataset that covers 102 natural languages. Third, we instruct-tune the foundation model with multilingual translation instructions, leading to our BigTranslate model. The preliminary experiments on multilingual translation show that BigTranslate performs comparably with 
ChatGPT and Google Translate in many languages and even outperforms ChatGPT in 8 language pairs. We release the BigTranslate model and hope it can advance the research progress.; More Details can be found at https://github.com/ZNLP/BigTranslate and https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18098",natural-language-processing,text-generation,https://huggingface.co/James-WYang/BigTranslate,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18098.pdf,License: lgpl-3.0,,,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 22,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 248,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 26.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 0

It is the most academic of all arcane traditions. The promise of uncovering new knowledge or proving (or discrediting) a theory of magic is usually required to rouse its practitioners from their laboratories, academies, and archives to pursue a life of adventure. Known as savants, followers of this tradition are a bookish lot who see beauty and mystery in the application of magic. The results of a spell are less interesting to them than the process that creates it. Some savants take a haughty attitude toward those who follow a tradition focused on a single school of magic, seeing them as provincial and lacking the sophistication needed to master true magic.

open_llama_7b,,,,,,,,,"In this repo, we present a permissively licensed open source reproduction of Meta AI's LLaMA large language model. We are releasing a 7B and 3B model trained on 1T tokens, as well as the preview of a 13B model trained on 600B tokens. We provide PyTorch and JAX weights of pre-trained OpenLLaMA models, as well as evaluation results and comparison against the original LLaMA models. Please see the project homepage of OpenLLaMA for more details.; We release the weights in two formats: an EasyLM format to be use with our EasyLM framework, and a PyTorch format to be used with the Hugging Face transformers library. Both our training framework EasyLM and the checkpoint weights are licensed permissively under the Apache 2.0 license.; Preview checkpoints can be directly loaded from Hugging Face Hub. Please note that it is advised to avoid using the Hugging Face fast tokenizer for now, as we¡¯ve observed that the auto-converted fast tokenizer sometimes gives incorrect tokenizations. This can be achieved by directly using the LlamaTokenizer class, or passing in the use_fast=False option for the AutoTokenizer class. See the following example for usage.; For more advanced usage, please follow the transformers LLaMA documentation.; The model can be evaluated with lm-eval-harness. However, due to the aforementioned tokenizer issue, we need to avoid using the fast tokenizer to obtain the correct results. This can be achieved by passing in use_fast=False to this part of lm-eval-harness, as shown in the example below:",natural-language-processing,text-generation,https://huggingface.co/openlm-research/open_llama_7b,,License: apache-2.0,Datasets: togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data-1T,,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 91,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 46892,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 13.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 6

; VisCPM is a family of open-source large multimodal models, which support multimodal conversational capabilities (VisCPM-Chat model) and text-to-image generation capabilities (VisCPM-Paint model) in both Chinese and English, achieving state-of-the-art peformance among Chinese open-source multimodal models. VisCPM is trained based on the large language model CPM-Bee with 10B parameters, fusing visual encoder (Q-Former) and visual decoder (Diffusion-UNet) to support visual inputs and outputs. Thanks to the good bilingual capability of CPM-Bee, VisCPM can be pre-trained with English multimodal data only and well generalize to achieve promising Chinese multimodal capabilities.; VisCPMÊÇÒ»¸ö¿ªÔ´µÄ¶àÄ£Ì¬´óÄ£ÐÍÏµÁÐ£¬Ö§³ÖÖÐÓ¢Ë«ÓïµÄ¶àÄ£Ì¬¶Ô»°ÄÜÁ¦£¨VisCPM-ChatÄ£ÐÍ£©ºÍÎÄµ½Í¼Éú³ÉÄÜÁ¦£¨VisCPM-PaintÄ£ÐÍ£©£¬ÔÚÖÐÎÄ¶àÄ£Ì¬¿ªÔ´Ä£ÐÍÖÐ´ïµ½×î¼ÑË®Æ½¡£VisCPM»ùÓÚ°ÙÒÚ²ÎÊýÁ¿ÓïÑÔ´óÄ£ÐÍCPM-Bee£¨10B£©ÑµÁ·£¬ÈÚºÏÊÓ¾õ±àÂëÆ÷£¨Q-Former£©ºÍÊÓ¾õ½âÂëÆ÷£¨Diffusion-UNet£©ÒÔÖ§³ÖÊÓ¾õÐÅºÅµÄÊäÈëºÍÊä³ö¡£µÃÒæÓÚCPM-Beeµ××ùÓÅÐãµÄË«ÓïÄÜÁ¦£¬VisCPM¿ÉÒÔ½öÍ¨¹ýÓ¢ÎÄ¶àÄ£Ì¬Êý¾ÝÔ¤ÑµÁ·£¬·º»¯ÊµÏÖÓÅÐãµÄÖÐÎÄ¶àÄ£Ì¬ÄÜÁ¦¡£",multimodel,feature-extraction,https://huggingface.co/openbmb/VisCPM-Chat,,,,Chinese; English,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 12,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 22,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 41.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 0

Redmond-Hermes-Coder,,,,,,,,,"Redmond-Hermes-Coder 15B is a state-of-the-art language model fine-tuned on over 300,000 instructions. This model was fine-tuned by Nous Research, with Teknium and Karan4D leading the fine tuning process and dataset curation, Redmond AI sponsoring the compute, and several other contributors.; This model was trained with a WizardCoder base, which itself uses a StarCoder base model. ; The model is truly great at code, but, it does come with a tradeoff though. While far better at code than the original Nous-Hermes built on Llama, it is worse than WizardCoder at pure code benchmarks, like HumanEval.; It comes in at 39% on HumanEval, with WizardCoder at 57%. This is a preliminary experiment, and we are exploring improvements now.; However, it does seem better at non-code than WizardCoder on a variety of things, including writing tasks.",natural-language-processing,text-generation,https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Redmond-Hermes-Coder,,License: gpl,,English,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 16,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 55,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 32.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 1

prometheus.safetensors,,,,,,,,,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB-BmFUdT7o; First, please take the time to watch the video, you wont regret it. ; I am proud to introduce to you an innovative workflow solution for all of your prompting needs! Prometheus is a custom model along with 30 Hypernetworks I like to call Latent Later Cameras. These are virtual cameras that have been embedded in to the latent space which allow you to choose the camera angle and camera shot for your subject.  These cameras put you in to the directors seat so that you always get the shot you envisioned in your mind. Besides being very flexible, the latent cameras also tend to be very cohesive and produce very good results through natural language prompting.  That means there is no need for a word salad in your positive or negative prompts.  In fact you can use the Hypernetworks without any negative prompts at all and still get very good results. As long as you follow very basic rules outlined in the video guide, on average you will get very good results. Thank you!; Please note the Hypernetworks work with all models...that are based on the 1.5 architecture... sorry if I misled in the video. Sorry no 2.0 or 2.1 support.  ; Don't forget to enable your dynamic prompts by checking the enable box, otherwise you can load the Hypernetworks manually, just know that the strength of the Hypernetworks should be at 0.55 by default, otherwise you will not get good results.

randomly masks 15% of the words in the input then run the entire masked sentence through the model and has to predict
the masked words. This is different from traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that usually see the words one
after the other, or from autoregressive models like GPT which internally mask the future tokens. It allows the model to
learn a bidirectional representation of the sentence.; This way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features

prot_bert_bfd,,,,,,,,,"Pretrained model on protein sequences using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective. It was introduced in
this paper and first released in
this repository. This model is trained on uppercase amino acids: it only works with capital letter amino acids.; ProtBert-BFD is based on Bert model which pretrained on a large corpus of protein sequences in a self-supervised fashion.
This means it was pretrained on the raw protein sequences only, with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of
publicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those protein sequences.; One important difference between our Bert model and the original Bert version is the way of dealing with sequences as separate documents
This means the Next sentence prediction is not used, as each sequence is treated as a complete document.
The masking follows the original Bert training with randomly masks 15% of the amino acids in the input. ; At the end, the feature extracted from this model revealed that the LM-embeddings from unlabeled data (only protein sequences) captured important biophysical properties governing protein
shape.
This implied learning some of the grammar of the language of life realized in protein sequences.; The model could be used for protein feature extraction or to be fine-tuned on downstream tasks.

kenlm,,,,,,,,,"This repo contains several KenLM models trained on different tokenized datasets and languages.KenLM models are probabilistic n-gram languge models that models. One use case of these models consist on fast perplexity estimation for filtering or sampling large datasets. For example, one could use a KenLM model trained on French Wikipedia to run inference on a large dataset and filter out samples that are very unlike to appear on Wikipedia (high perplexity), or very simple non-informative sentences that could appear repeatedly (low perplexity).; At the root of this repo you will find different directories named after the dataset models were trained on (e.g. wikipedia, oscar). Within each directory, you will find several models trained on different language subsets of the dataset (e.g. en (English), es (Spanish), fr (French)). For each language you will find three different files; The models have been trained using some of the preprocessing steps from cc_net, in particular replacing numbers with zeros and normalizing punctuation. So, it is important to keep the default values for the parameters: lower_case, remove_accents, normalize_numbers and punctuation when using the pre-trained models in order to replicate the same pre-processing steps at inference time.; In the example above we see that, since Wikipedia is a collection of encyclopedic articles, a KenLM model trained on it will naturally give lower perplexity scores to sentences with formal language and no grammar mistakes than colloquial sentences with grammar mistakes.; Unable to determine this model¡¯s pipeline type.

drln,,,,,,,,,"DRLN model pre-trained on DIV2K (800 images training, augmented to 4000 images, 100 images validation) for 2x, 3x and 4x image super resolution. It was introduced in the paper Densely Residual Laplacian Super-resolution by Anwar et al. (2020) and first released in this repository. ; The goal of image super resolution is to restore a high resolution (HR) image from a single low resolution (LR) image. The image below shows the ground truth (HR), the bicubic upscaling and model upscaling.; ; Super-Resolution convolutional neural networks have recently demonstrated high-quality restoration for single images. However, existing algorithms often require very deep architectures and long training times. Furthermore, current convolutional neural networks for super-resolution are unable to exploit features at multiple scales and weigh them equally, limiting their learning capability. In this exposition, we present a compact and accurate super-resolution algorithm namely, Densely Residual Laplacian Network (DRLN). The proposed network employs cascading residual on the residual structure to allow the flow of low-frequency information to focus on learning high and mid-level features. In addition, deep supervision is achieved via the densely concatenated residual blocks settings, which also helps in learning from high-level complex features. Moreover, we propose Laplacian attention to model the crucial features to learn the inter and intra-level dependencies between the feature maps. Furthermore, comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on low-resolution, noisy low-resolution, and real historical image benchmark datasets illustrate that our DRLN algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods visually and accurately.; You can use the pre-trained models for upscaling your images 2x, 3x and 4x.

Two heads are added on top of the decoder outputs in order to perform object detection: a linear layer for the class labels and a MLP (multi-layer perceptron) for the bounding boxes. The model uses so-called object queries to detect objects in an image. Each object query looks for a particular object in the image. For COCO, the number of object queries is set to 100. ; The model is trained using a ""bipartite matching loss"": one compares the predicted classes + bounding boxes of each of the N = 100 object queries to the ground truth annotations, padded up to the same length N (so if an image only contains 4 objects, 96 annotations will just have a ""no object"" as class and ""no bounding box"" as bounding box). The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to create an optimal one-to-one mapping between each of the N queries and each of the N annotations. Next, standard cross-entropy (for the classes) and a linear combination of the L1 and generalized IoU loss (for the bounding boxes) are used to optimize the parameters of the model.; DETR can be naturally extended to perform panoptic segmentation, by adding a mask head on top of the decoder outputs.",computer-vision,image-segmentation,https://huggingface.co/facebook/detr-resnet-50-panoptic,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12872.pdf,License: apache-2.0,Datasets: coco,,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 77,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 11828,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 172.0MB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 75

This paper presents XLSR which learns cross-lingual speech representations by pretraining a single model from the raw waveform of speech in multiple languages. We build on wav2vec 2.0 which is trained by solving a contrastive task over masked latent speech representations and jointly learns a quantization of the latents shared across languages. The resulting model is fine-tuned on labeled data and experiments show that cross-lingual pretraining significantly outperforms monolingual pretraining. On the CommonVoice benchmark, XLSR shows a relative phoneme error rate reduction of 72% compared to the best known results. On BABEL, our approach improves word error rate by 16% relative compared to a comparable system. Our approach enables a single multilingual speech recognition model which is competitive to strong individual models. Analysis shows that the latent discrete speech representations are shared across languages with increased sharing for related languages. We hope to catalyze research in low-resource speech understanding by releasing XLSR-53, a large model pretrained in 53 languages.",,,https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13979.pdf,License: apache-2.0,Datasets: common_voice,multilingual,PyTorch; JAX; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 50,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 37577,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 3.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 4

low-light-image-enhancement,,,,,,,,,"Original Author: Soumik Rakshit 
Date created: 2021/09/18 
HF Contribution: Harveen Singh Chadha
Dataset: LOL Dataset; Zero-Reference Deep Curve Estimation or Zero-DCE formulates low-light image enhancement as the task of estimating an image-specific tonal curve with a deep neural network. In this example, we train a lightweight deep network, DCE-Net, to estimate pixel-wise and high-order tonal curves for dynamic range adjustment of a given image.; Zero-DCE takes a low-light image as input and produces high-order tonal curves as its output. These curves are then used for pixel-wise adjustment on the dynamic range of the input to obtain an enhanced image. The curve estimation process is done in such a way that it maintains the range of the enhanced image and preserves the contrast of neighboring pixels. This curve estimation is inspired by curves adjustment used in photo editing software such as Adobe Photoshop where users can adjust points throughout an image¡¯s tonal range.; Zero-DCE is appealing because of its relaxed assumptions with regard to reference images: it does not require any input/output image pairs during training. This is achieved through a set of carefully formulated non-reference loss functions, which implicitly measure the enhancement quality and guide the training of the network.; Sample Images:",computer-vision,image-to-image,https://huggingface.co/keras-io/low-light-image-enhancement,,License: apache-2.0,,,Keras,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 14,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 43,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 347.0MB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 1

beit-base-patch16-384,,,,,,,,,"BEiT model pre-trained in a self-supervised fashion on ImageNet-21k (14 million images, 21,841 classes) at resolution 224x224, and fine-tuned on ImageNet 2012 (1 million images, 1,000 classes) at resolution 384x384. It was introduced in the paper BEIT: BERT Pre-Training of Image Transformers by Hangbo Bao, Li Dong and Furu Wei and first released in this repository. ; Disclaimer: The team releasing BEiT did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.; The BEiT model is a Vision Transformer (ViT), which is a transformer encoder model (BERT-like). In contrast to the original ViT model, BEiT is pretrained on a large collection of images in a self-supervised fashion, namely ImageNet-21k, at a resolution of 224x224 pixels. The pre-training objective for the model is to predict visual tokens from the encoder of OpenAI's DALL-E's VQ-VAE, based on masked patches.
Next, the model was fine-tuned in a supervised fashion on ImageNet (also referred to as ILSVRC2012), a dataset comprising 1 million images and 1,000 classes, also at resolution 224x224.; Images are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. Contrary to the original ViT models, BEiT models do use relative position embeddings (similar to T5) instead of absolute position embeddings, and perform classification of images by mean-pooling the final hidden states of the patches, instead of placing a linear layer on top of the final hidden state of the [CLS] token.; By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of images that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled images for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire image. Alternatively, one can mean-pool the final hidden states of the patch embeddings, and place a linear layer on top of that.",computer-vision,image-classification,https://huggingface.co/microsoft/beit-base-patch16-384,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08254.pdf,License: apache-2.0,Datasets: imagenet; imagenet-21k,,PyTorch; JAX; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 3,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 707,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 726.0MB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 0

Liu in Here the abstract:; Transfer learning, where a model is first pre-trained on a data-rich task before being fine-tuned on a downstream task, has emerged as a powerful technique in natural language processing (NLP). The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts every language problem into a text-to-text format.

Two heads are added on top of the decoder outputs in order to perform object detection: a linear layer for the class labels and a MLP (multi-layer perceptron) for the bounding boxes. The model uses so-called object queries to detect objects in an image. Each object query looks for a particular object in the image. For COCO, the number of object queries is set to 100. ; The model is trained using a ""bipartite matching loss"": one compares the predicted classes + bounding boxes of each of the N = 100 object queries to the ground truth annotations, padded up to the same length N (so if an image only contains 4 objects, 96 annotations will just have a ""no object"" as class and ""no bounding box"" as bounding box). The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to create an optimal one-to-one mapping between each of the N queries and each of the N annotations. Next, standard cross-entropy (for the classes) and a linear combination of the L1 and generalized IoU loss (for the bounding boxes) are used to optimize the parameters of the model.; ",computer-vision,object-detection,https://huggingface.co/SenseTime/deformable-detr,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.04159.pdf,License: apache-2.0,Datasets: coco,,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 9,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 12226,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 161.0MB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 1

parrot_paraphraser_on_T5,,,,,,,,,"Parrot is a paraphrase based utterance augmentation framework purpose built to accelerate training NLU models. A paraphrase framework is more than just a paraphrasing model. For more  details on the library and usage please refer to the github page; Huggingface lists 12 paraphrase models, RapidAPI lists 7 fremium and commercial paraphrasers like QuillBot, Rasa has discussed an experimental paraphraser for augmenting text data here, Sentence-transfomers offers a paraphrase mining utility and NLPAug offers word level augmentation with a PPDB (a multi-million paraphrase database). While these attempts at paraphrasing are great, there are still some gaps and paraphrasing is NOT yet a mainstream option for text augmentation in building NLU models....Parrot is a humble attempt to fill some of these gaps.; What is a good paraphrase? Almost all conditioned text generation models are validated  on 2 factors, (1) if the generated text conveys the same meaning as the original context (Adequacy) (2) if the text is fluent / grammatically correct english (Fluency). For instance Neural Machine Translation outputs are tested for Adequacy and Fluency. But a good paraphrase should be adequate and fluent while being as different as possible on the surface lexical form. With respect to this definition, the  3 key metrics that measures the quality of paraphrases are:; Parrot offers knobs to control Adequacy, Fluency and Diversity as per your needs.; What makes a paraphraser a good augmentor?

rudalle-Emojich,,,,,,,,,"; Model was trained by Sber AI; ; ? Emojich is a 1.3 billion params model from the family GPT3-like, it generates emoji-style images with the brain of ? Malevich.; The main goal of fine-tuning is trying to keep the generalization of ruDALL-E Malevich (XL)
model on text to emoji tasks. ruDALL-E Malevich is a multi-modality big pretrained transformer, that uses images and texts.
The idea with freezing feedforward and self-attention layers in pretrained transformer is demonstrated high performance in changing different modalities.
Also, the model has a good chance for over-fitting text modality and lost generalization. 
To deal with this problem is increased coefficient 10^3 in weighted cross-entropy loss for image codebooks part.

The architecture is a 6-layer DistilBERT, without architecture additions or modifications (we only change the weights during training) - to receive a query/passage representation we pool the CLS vector.

BiomedNLP-KRISSBERT-PubMed-UMLS-EL,,,,,,,,,"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07887.pdf; Entity linking faces significant challenges such as prolific variations and prevalent ambiguities, especially in high-value domains with myriad entities. Standard classification approaches suffer from the annotation bottleneck and cannot effectively handle unseen entities. Zero-shot entity linking has emerged as a promising direction for generalizing to new entities, but it still requires example gold entity mentions during training and canonical descriptions for all entities, both of which are rarely available outside of Wikipedia (Logeswaran et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020). We explore Knowledge-RIch Self-Supervision (KRISS) and train a contextual encoder (KRISSBERT) for entity linking, by leveraging readily available unlabeled text and domain knowledge.; Specifically, the KRISSBERT model is initialized with PubMedBERT parameters, and then continuously pretrained using biomedical entity names from the UMLS ontology to self-supervise entity linking examples from PubMed abstracts. Experiments on seven standard biomedical entity linking datasets show that KRISSBERT attains new state of the art, outperforming prior self-supervised methods by as much as 20 absolute points in accuracy.
See Zhang et al., 2021 for the details.; Note that some prior systems like BioSyn, SapBERT, and their follow-up work (e.g., Lai et al., 2021) claimed to do entity linking, but their systems completely ignore the context of an entity mention, and can only predict a surface form in the entity dictionary (See Figure 1 in BioSyn), not the canonical entity ID (e.g., CUI in UMLS). Therefore, they can't disambiguate ambiguous mentions. For instance, given the entity mention ""ER"" in the sentence ""ER crowding has become a wide-spread problem"", their systems ignore the sentence context, and simply predict the closest surface form, which is just ""ER"". Multiple entities share this surface form as a potential name or alias, such as Emergency Room (C0562508), Estrogen Receptor Gene (C1414461), and Endoplasmic Reticulum(C0014239). Without using the context information, their systems can't resolve such ambiguity and pinpoint the correct entity Emergency Room (C0562508). More problematically, their evaluation would deem such an ambiguous prediction as correct. Consequently, the reported results in their papers do not reflect true performance on entity linking.; Here, we use the MedMentions data to show you how to 1) generate prototype embeddings, and 2) run entity linking.",multimodel,feature-extraction,https://huggingface.co/microsoft/BiomedNLP-KRISSBERT-PubMed-UMLS-EL,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07887.pdf,License: mit,,English,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 13,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 497,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 438.0MB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 0

publicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. More precisely, it
was pretrained with two objectives:; This way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features

classifier using the features produced by the BERT model as inputs.; This is a fine-tuned downstream version of the bert-base-uncased model for sentiment analysis, this model is not intended for

However, each Medium article can have at most five tags, therefore the author needs to choose what he/she believes are the best tags (mainly for SEO-related purposes). This means that an article with the ""Python"" tag may have not the ""Programming Languages"" tag, even though the first implies the latter.; To clean the dataset accounting for this problem, a hand-made taxonomy of about 1000 tags was built.
