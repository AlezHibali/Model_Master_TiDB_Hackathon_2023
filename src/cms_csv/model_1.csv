This model was trained from the original weights using 9,923 clips and 29,769 tagged frames at 24 frames, 576x320 resolution.
zeroscope_v2_567w is specifically designed for upscaling with zeroscope_v2_XL using vid2vid in the 1111 text2video extension by kabachuha. Leveraging this model as a preliminary step allows for superior overall compositions at higher resolutions in zeroscope_v2_XL, permitting faster exploration in 576x320 before transitioning to a high-resolution render. See some example outputs that have been upscaled to 1024x576 using zeroscope_v2_XL. (courtesy of dotsimulate); zeroscope_v2_576w uses 7.9gb of vram when rendering 30 frames at 576x320; For upscaling, it's recommended to use zeroscope_v2_XL via vid2vid in the 1111 extension. It works best at 1024x576 with a denoise strength between 0.66 and 0.85.

example outputs (courtesy of dotsimulate); A watermark-free Modelscope-based video model capable of generating high quality video at 1024 x 576. This model was trained from the original weights with offset noise using 9,923 clips and 29,769 tagged frames at 24 frames, 1024x576 resolution.
zeroscope_v2_XL is specifically designed for upscaling content made with zeroscope_v2_576w using vid2vid in the 1111 text2video extension by kabachuha. Leveraging this model as an upscaler allows for superior overall compositions at higher resolutions, permitting faster exploration in 576x320 (or 448x256) before transitioning to a high-resolution render.; zeroscope_v2_XL uses 15.3gb of vram when rendering 30 frames at 1024x576; For upscaling, it's recommended to use the 1111 extension. It works best at 1024x576 with a denoise strength between 0.66 and 0.85.

We release a smaller 3B variant of the LongLLaMA model on a permissive license (Apache 2.0) and inference code supporting longer contexts on Hugging Face. Our model weights can serve as the drop-in replacement of LLaMA in existing implementations (for short context up to 2048 tokens). Additionally, we provide evaluation results and comparisons against the original OpenLLaMA models. Stay tuned for further updates.; Focused Transformer: Contrastive Training for Context Scaling (FoT) presents a simple method for endowing language models with the ability to handle context consisting possibly of millions of tokens while training on significantly shorter input. FoT permits a subset of attention layers to access a memory cache of (key, value) pairs to extend the context length. The distinctive aspect of FoT is its training procedure, drawing from contrastive learning. Specifically, we deliberately expose the memory attention layers to both relevant and irrelevant keys (like negative samples from unrelated documents). This strategy incentivizes the model to differentiate keys connected with semantically diverse values, thereby enhancing their structure. This, in turn, makes it possible to extrapolate the effective context length much beyond what is seen in training.

The method works by posing the sequence to be classified as the NLI premise and to construct a hypothesis from each candidate label.

The second, ft-MSE, was resumed from ft-EMA and uses EMA weights and was trained for another 280k steps using a different loss, with more emphasis 
on MSE reconstruction (MSE + 0.1 * LPIPS). It produces somewhat ``smoother'' outputs. The batch size for both versions was 192 (16 A100s, batch size 12 per GPU).

The Stable Diffusion 2.1 version is marginally more effective, as it was developed to address my specific needs. However, this 1.5 version model was also trained on the same dataset for those who are using the older version.; These models perform quite well in most cases, but please note that they are not 100% accurate. In some instances, the QR code shape might not come through as expected. You can increase the ControlNet weight to emphasize the QR code shape. However, be cautious as this might negatively impact the style of your output.To optimize for scanning, please generate your QR codes with correction mode 'H' (30%).; To balance between style and shape, a gentle fine-tuning of the control weight might be required based on the individual input and the desired output, aswell as the correct prompt. Some prompts do not work until you increase the weight by a lot. The process of finding the right balance between these factors is part art and part science. For the best results, it is recommended to generate your artwork at a resolution of 768. This allows for a higher level of detail in the final product, enhancing the quality and effectiveness of the QR code-based artwork.; The simplest way to use this is to place the .safetensors model and its .yaml config file in the folder where your other controlnet models are installed, which varies per application. 
For usage in auto1111 they can be placed in the webui/models/ControlNet folder. They can be loaded using the controlnet webui extension which you can install through the extensions tab in the webui (https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet). Make sure to enable your controlnet unit and set your input image as the QR code. Set the model to either the SD2.1 or 1.5 version depending on your base stable diffusion model, or it will error. No pre-processor is needed, though you can use the invert pre-processor for a different variation of results. 768 is the preferred resolution for generation since it allows for more detail.

This is in contrast with the commonly employed strategy where a very large number of training examples (tens of thousands to even millions) of widely varying quality are used.; For LIMARP a similar approach was used, with the difference that the conversational data is almost entirely human-generated.

was pretrained with two objectives:; This way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features

classifier using the features produced by the BERT model as inputs.; BERT has originally been released in base and large variations, for cased and uncased input text.

zero-shot classification. The underlying model was pre-trained by Microsoft on the

As of December 2021, mDeBERTa-base is the best performing multilingual base-sized transformer model,

Note that the XNLI contains a training set of 15 machine translated versions of the MNLI dataset for 15 languages, but due to quality issues with these machine translations, this model was only trained on the professional translations from the XNLI development set and the original English MNLI training set (392 702 texts). Not using machine translated texts can avoid overfitting the model to the 15 languages; avoids catastrophic forgetting of the other 85 languages mDeBERTa was pre-trained on; and significantly reduces training costs. ; mDeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-xnli was trained using the Hugging Face trainer with the following hyperparameters.; The model was evaluated on the XNLI test set on 15 languages (5010 texts per language, 75150 in total). Note that multilingual NLI models are capable of classifying NLI texts without receiving NLI training data in the specific language (cross-lingual transfer).

In some instances, the QR code shape might not come through as expected. You can increase the ControlNet weight to emphasize the QR code shape. However, be cautious as this might negatively impact the style of your output.To optimize for scanning, please generate your QR codes with correction mode 'H' (30%).; To balance between style and shape, a gentle fine-tuning of the control weight might be required based on the individual input and the desired output, aswell as the correct prompt. Some prompts do not work until you increase the weight by a lot. The process of finding the right balance between these factors is part art and part science.

faster for inference or downstream tasks.; You can use the raw model for either masked language modeling or next sentence prediction, but it's mostly intended to
be fine-tuned on a downstream task. See the model hub to look for
fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.; Note that this model is primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on tasks that use the whole sentence (potentially masked)

Model performance measures: NLLB-200 model was evaluated using BLEU, spBLEU, and chrF++ metrics widely adopted by machine translation community. Additionally, we performed human evaluation with the XSTS protocol and measured the toxicity of the generated translations.; ? We used parallel multilingual data from a variety of sources to train the model. We provide detailed report on data selection and construction process in Section 5 in the paper. We also used monolingual data constructed from Common Crawl. We provide more details in Section 5.2.; ? In this work, we took a reflexive approach in technological development to ensure that we prioritize human users and minimize risks that could be transferred to them. While we reflect on our ethical considerations throughout the article, here are some additional points to highlight. For one, many languages chosen for this study are low-resource languages, with a heavy emphasis on African languages. While quality translation could improve education and information access in many in these communities, such an access could also make groups with lower levels of digital literacy more vulnerable to misinformation or online scams. The latter scenarios could arise if bad actors misappropriate our work for nefarious activities, which we conceive as an example of unintended use. Regarding data acquisition, the training data used for model development were mined from various publicly available sources on the web. Although we invested heavily in data cleaning, personally identifiable information may not be entirely eliminated. Finally, although we did our best to optimize for translation quality, mistranslations produced by the model could remain. Although the odds are low, this could have adverse impact on those who rely on these translations to make important decisions (particularly when related to health and safety).",natural-language-processing,translation,https://huggingface.co/facebook/nllb-200-3.3B,,License: cc-by-nc-4.0,Datasets: flores-200,196 languages,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 82,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 51820,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 18.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 14

The license used is MIT.; Motivated by the success of T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) in pre-trained natural language processing models, we propose a unified-modal SpeechT5 framework that explores the encoder-decoder pre-training for self-supervised speech/text representation learning. The SpeechT5 framework consists of a shared encoder-decoder network and six modal-specific (speech/text) pre/post-nets. After preprocessing the input speech/text through the pre-nets, the shared encoder-decoder network models the sequence-to-sequence transformation, and then the post-nets generate the output in the speech/text modality based on the output of the decoder.; Leveraging large-scale unlabeled speech and text data, we pre-train SpeechT5 to learn a unified-modal representation, hoping to improve the modeling capability for both speech and text. To align the textual and speech information into this unified semantic space, we propose a cross-modal vector quantization approach that randomly mixes up speech/text states with latent units as the interface between encoder and decoder.",audio,text-to-speech,https://huggingface.co/microsoft/speecht5_tts,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07205.pdf; https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.09700.pdf,License: mit,Datasets: libritts,,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 181,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 36978,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 585.0MB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 172

We excluded cells with high mutational burdens (e.g. malignant cells and immortalized cell lines) that could lead to substantial network rewiring without companion genome sequencing to facilitate interpretation. Each single cell¡¯s transcriptome is presented to the model as a rank value encoding where genes are ranked by their expression in that cell normalized by their expression across the entire Genecorpus-30M. The rank value encoding provides a nonparametric representation of that cell¡¯s transcriptome and takes advantage of the many observations of each gene¡¯s expression across Genecorpus-30M to prioritize genes that distinguish cell state. Specifically, this method will deprioritize ubiquitously highly-expressed housekeeping genes by normalizing them to a lower rank. Conversely, genes such as transcription factors that may be lowly expressed when they are expressed but highly distinguish cell state will move to a higher rank within the encoding. Furthermore, this rank-based approach may be more robust against technical artifacts that may systematically bias the absolute transcript counts value while the overall relative ranking of genes within each cell remains more stable. ; The rank value encoding of each single cell¡¯s transcriptome then proceeds through six transformer encoder units. Pretraining was accomplished using a masked learning objective where 15% of the genes within each transcriptome were masked and the model was trained to predict which gene should be within each masked position in that specific cell state using the context of the remaining unmasked genes. A major strength of this approach is that it is entirely self-supervised and can be accomplished on completely unlabeled data, which allows the inclusion of large amounts of training data without being restricted to samples with accompanying labels.; We detail applications and results in our manuscript.

Among the two main branches of pre-trained language models in the general language domain, i.e. BERT (and its variants) and GPT (and its variants), the first one has been extensively studied in the biomedical domain, such as BioBERT and PubMedBERT. While they have achieved great success on a variety of discriminative downstream biomedical tasks, the lack of generation ability constrains their application scope. In this paper, we propose BioGPT, a domain-specific generative Transformer language model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical literature. We evaluate BioGPT on six biomedical natural language processing tasks and demonstrate that our model outperforms previous models on most tasks. Especially, we get 44.98%, 38.42% and 40.76% F1 score on BC5CDR, KD-DTI and DDI end-to-end relation extraction tasks, respectively, and 78.2% accuracy on PubMedQA, creating a new record. Our case study on text generation further demonstrates the advantage of BioGPT on biomedical literature to generate fluent descriptions for biomedical terms.; If you find BioGPT useful in your research, please cite the following paper:",natural-language-processing,text-generation,https://huggingface.co/microsoft/BioGPT-Large-PubMedQA,,License: mit,Datasets: pubmed_qa,English,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 60,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 1525,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 6.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 16

This model was trained by MosaicML.; MPT-30B is part of the family of Mosaic Pretrained Transformer (MPT) models, which use a modified transformer architecture optimized for efficient training and inference.; MPT-30B comes with special features that differentiate it from other LLMs, including an 8k token context window (which can be further extended via finetuning; see MPT-7B-StoryWriter), support for context-length extrapolation via ALiBi, and efficient inference + training via FlashAttention.

codet5p-110m-embedding,,,,,,,,,"CodeT5+ is a new family of open code large language models
with an encoder-decoder architecture that can flexibly operate in different modes (i.e. encoder-only, decoder-only,
and encoder-decoder) to support a wide range of code understanding and generation tasks.
It is introduced in the paper:; CodeT5+: Open Code Large Language Models for Code Understanding and Generation
by Yue Wang*, Hung Le*, Akhilesh Deepak Gotmare, Nghi D.Q. Bui, Junnan Li, Steven C.H. Hoi (*
indicates equal contribution).; Compared to the original CodeT5 family (base: 220M, large: 770M), CodeT5+ is pretrained with a diverse set of
pretraining tasks including span denoising, causal language modeling, contrastive learning, and text-code
matching to learn rich representations from both unimodal code data and bimodal code-text data.
Additionally, it employs a simple yet effective compute-efficient pretraining method to initialize the model
components with frozen off-the-shelf LLMs such as CodeGen to efficiently scale
up the model (i.e. 2B, 6B, 16B), and adopts a ""shallow encoder and deep decoder"" architecture.
Furthermore, it is instruction-tuned to align with natural language instructions (see our InstructCodeT5+ 16B)
following Code Alpaca.; This checkpoint consists of an encoder of CodeT5+ 220M model (pretrained from 2 stages on both unimodal and bimodal) and a projection layer, which can be used to extract code
embeddings of 256 dimension. It can be easily loaded using the AutoModel functionality and employs the
same CodeT5 tokenizer.; This checkpoint is trained on the stricter permissive subset of the deduplicated version of
the github-code dataset.
The data is preprocessed by reserving only permissively licensed code (""mit"" ¡°apache-2¡±, ¡°bsd-3-clause¡±, ¡°bsd-2-clause¡±,
¡°cc0-1.0¡±, ¡°unlicense¡±, ¡°isc¡±).

If you are looking for the model to use with the original CompVis Stable Diffusion codebase, come here.; You can integrate this fine-tuned VAE decoder to your existing diffusers workflows, by including a vae argument to the StableDiffusionPipeline; We publish two kl-f8 autoencoder versions, finetuned from the original kl-f8 autoencoder on a 1:1 ratio of LAION-Aesthetics and LAION-Humans, an unreleased subset containing only SFW images of humans. The intent was to fine-tune on the Stable Diffusion training set (the autoencoder was originally trained on OpenImages) but also enrich the dataset with images of humans to improve the reconstruction of faces.
The first, ft-EMA, was resumed from the original checkpoint, trained for 313198 steps and uses EMA weights. It uses the same loss configuration as the original checkpoint (L1 + LPIPS).
The second, ft-MSE, was resumed from ft-EMA and uses EMA weights and was trained for another 280k steps using a different loss, with more emphasis 
on MSE reconstruction (MSE + 0.1 * LPIPS). It produces somewhat ``smoother'' outputs. The batch size for both versions was 192 (16 A100s, batch size 12 per GPU).
To keep compatibility with existing models, only the decoder part was finetuned; the checkpoints can be used as a drop-in replacement for the existing autoencoder.; Original kl-f8 VAE vs f8-ft-EMA vs f8-ft-MSE; Visualization of reconstructions on  256x256 images from the COCO2017 validation dataset.

Models trained primarily on code data will also have a more skewed demographic bias commensurate with the demographics of the GitHub community, for more on this see the StarCoder dataset which is derived from The Stack.; Since the base model was pretrained on a large corpus of code, it may produce code snippets that are syntactically valid but semantically incorrect.

The ""Split-Einsum"" zips just have a single file and don't use a holding folder.  To make things even more confusing, on some Mac systems, an individual ControlNet model file, for example Canny-5x5.mlmodelc, will appear in Finder as a folder, not a file.  You want to move the Canny-5x5.mlmodelc file or folder (and other .mlmodelc files or folders) into your ControlNet store folder.  Don't move the plain ""Canny"" folder.

was pretrained with two objectives:; This way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features

It was introduced to show that multilingual translation models can be created through multilingual fine-tuning. 
Instead of fine-tuning on one direction, a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on many directions simultaneously. mBART-50 is created using the original mBART model and extended to add extra 25 languages to support multilingual machine translation models of 50 languages. The pre-training objective is explained below.; Multilingual Denoising Pretraining: The model incorporates N languages by concatenating data: 
D = {D1, ..., DN } where each Di is a collection of monolingual documents in language i. The source documents are noised using two schemes, 
first randomly shuffling the original sentences' order, and second a novel in-filling scheme, 
where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. The model is then tasked to reconstruct the original text. 
35% of each instance's words are masked by random sampling a span length according to a Poisson distribution (¦Ë = 3.5).
The decoder input is the original text with one position offset. A language id symbol LID is used as the initial token to predict the sentence.; mbart-large-50 is pre-trained model and primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on translation tasks. It can also be fine-tuned on other multilingual sequence-to-sequence tasks. 
See the model hub to look for fine-tuned versions.; As the model is multilingual, it expects the sequences in a different format. A special language id token is used as a prefix in both the source and target text. The text format is [lang_code] X [eos] with X being the source or target text respectively and lang_code is source_lang_code for source text and tgt_lang_code for target text. bos is never used.

If you are looking for the model to use with the original CompVis Stable Diffusion codebase, come here. ; You can integrate this fine-tuned VAE decoder to your existing diffusers workflows, by including a vae argument to the StableDiffusionPipeline; We publish two kl-f8 autoencoder versions, finetuned from the original kl-f8 autoencoder on a 1:1 ratio of LAION-Aesthetics and LAION-Humans, an unreleased subset containing only SFW images of humans. The intent was to fine-tune on the Stable Diffusion training set (the autoencoder was originally trained on OpenImages) but also enrich the dataset with images of humans to improve the reconstruction of faces.
The first, ft-EMA, was resumed from the original checkpoint, trained for 313198 steps and uses EMA weights. It uses the same loss configuration as the original checkpoint (L1 + LPIPS).
The second, ft-MSE, was resumed from ft-EMA and uses EMA weights and was trained for another 280k steps using a different loss, with more emphasis 
on MSE reconstruction (MSE + 0.1 * LPIPS). It produces somewhat ``smoother'' outputs. The batch size for both versions was 192 (16 A100s, batch size 12 per GPU).
To keep compatibility with existing models, only the decoder part was finetuned; the checkpoints can be used as a drop-in replacement for the existing autoencoder.; Original kl-f8 VAE vs f8-ft-EMA vs f8-ft-MSE; Visualization of reconstructions on  256x256 images from the COCO2017 validation dataset.

However, most existing pre-trained models only excel in either understanding-based tasks or generation-based tasks. Furthermore, performance improvement has been largely achieved by scaling up the dataset with noisy image-text pairs collected from the web, which is a suboptimal source of supervision. In this paper, we propose BLIP, a new VLP framework which transfers flexibly to both vision-language understanding and generation tasks. BLIP effectively utilizes the noisy web data by bootstrapping the captions, where a captioner generates synthetic captions and a filter removes the noisy ones. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of vision-language tasks, such as image-text retrieval (+2.7% in average recall@1), image captioning (+2.8% in CIDEr), and VQA (+1.6% in VQA score). BLIP also demonstrates strong generalization ability when directly transferred to videolanguage tasks in a zero-shot manner.

masked screenshots of web pages into simplified HTML. The web, with its richness of visual elements cleanly reflected in the HTML structure, provides a large
source of pretraining data well suited to the diversity of downstream tasks. Intuitively, this objective subsumes common pretraining signals such as OCR, language modeling, image captioning. In addition to the novel pretraining strategy,
we introduce a variable-resolution input representation and a more flexible integration of language and vision inputs, where language prompts such as questions
are rendered directly on top of the input image. For the first time, we show that a
single pretrained model can achieve state-of-the-art results in six out of nine tasks

Comprehending plots and charts requires strong reasoning skills. Prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) models require at least tens of thousands of training examples and their reasoning capabilities are still much limited, especially on complex human-written queries. This paper presents the first one-shot solution to visual language reasoning. We decompose the challenge of visual language reasoning into two steps: (1) plot-to-text translation, and (2) reasoning over the translated text. The key in this method is a modality conversion module, named as DePlot, which translates the image of a plot or chart to a linearized table. The output of DePlot can then be directly used to prompt a pretrained large language model (LLM), exploiting the few-shot reasoning capabilities of LLMs. To obtain DePlot, we standardize the plot-to-table task by establishing unified task formats and metrics, and train DePlot end-to-end on this task. DePlot can then be used off-the-shelf together with LLMs in a plug-and-play fashion. Compared with a SOTA model finetuned on more than >28k data points, DePlot+LLM with just one-shot prompting achieves a 24.0% improvement over finetuned SOTA on human-written queries from the task of chart QA.; You can run a prediction by querying an input image together with a question as follows:; You can use the convert_pix2struct_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py script as follows:",multimodel,visual-question-answering,https://huggingface.co/google/deplot,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10505.pdf,License: apache-2.0,,5 languages,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 48,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 7488,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 1.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 6

? Donate to OpenAccess AI Collective to help us keep building great tools and models!; Manticore is available at https://huggingface.co/openaccess-ai-collective/manticore-13b and fixes many issues with Wizard Mega and adds new datasets to the training.; Wizard Mega is a Llama 13B model fine-tuned on the ShareGPT, WizardLM, and Wizard-Vicuna datasets. These particular datasets have all been filtered to remove responses where the model responds with ""As an AI language model..."", etc or when the model refuses to respond.; Try out the model in HF Spaces. The demo uses a quantized GGML version of the model to quickly return predictions on smaller GPUs (and even CPUs). Quantized GGML may have some minimal loss of model quality.; The Wizard Mega 13B SFT model is being released after two epochs as the eval loss increased during the 3rd (final planned epoch). Because of this, we have preliminarily decided to use the epoch 2 checkpoint as the final release candidate. https://wandb.ai/wing-lian/vicuna-13b/runs/5uebgm49",natural-language-processing,text-generation,https://huggingface.co/openaccess-ai-collective/wizard-mega-13b,,,Datasets: anon8231489123/ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered; ehartford/wizard_vicuna_70k_unfiltered; ehartford/WizardLM_alpaca_evol_instruct_70k_unfiltered,English,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 100,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 740,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 26.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 12

It was trained using LoRA and quantized, to reduce memory footprint. ; Steps to load this model:; The following README is taken from the source page medalpaca; The training data for this project was sourced from various resources. 
Firstly, we used Anki flashcards to automatically generate questions, 
from the front of the cards and anwers from the back of the card. 
Secondly, we generated medical question-answer pairs from Wikidoc. 
We extracted paragraphs with relevant headings, and used Chat-GPT 3.5 
to generate questions from the headings and using the corresponding paragraphs 
as answers. This dataset is still under development and we believe 
that approximately 70% of these question answer pairs are factual correct. 
Thirdly, we used StackExchange to extract question-answer pairs, taking the 
top-rated question from five categories: Academia, Bioinformatics, Biology, 
Fitness, and Health. Additionally, we used a dataset from ChatDoctor 
consisting of 200,000 question-answer pairs, available at https://github.com/Kent0n-Li/ChatDoctor.",natural-language-processing,text-generation,https://huggingface.co/nmitchko/medguanaco-lora-65b-GPTQ,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.14070.pdf,License: cc,,English,Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 8,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 0,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 336.0MB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 0

The Stable Diffusion 2.1 version is marginally more effective, as it was developed to address my specific needs. However, a 1.5 version model was also trained on the same dataset for those who are using the older version.; These models perform quite well in most cases, but please note that they are not 100% accurate. In some instances, the QR code shape might not come through as expected. You can increase the ControlNet weight to emphasize the QR code shape. However, be cautious as this might negatively impact the style of your output.To optimize for scanning, please generate your QR codes with correction mode 'H' (30%).; To balance between style and shape, a gentle fine-tuning of the control weight might be required based on the individual input and the desired output, aswell as the correct prompt. Some prompts do not work until you increase the weight by a lot. The process of finding the right balance between these factors is part art and part science. For the best results, it is recommended to generate your artwork at a resolution of 768. This allows for a higher level of detail in the final product, enhancing the quality and effectiveness of the QR code-based artwork.; The simplest way to use this is to place the .safetensors model and its .yaml config file in the folder where your other controlnet models are installed, which varies per application. 
For usage in auto1111 they can be placed in the webui/models/ControlNet folder. They can be loaded using the controlnet webui extension which you can install through the extensions tab in the webui (https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet). Make sure to enable your controlnet unit and set your input image as the QR code. Set the model to either the SD2.1 or 1.5 version depending on your base stable diffusion model, or it will error. No pre-processor is needed, though you can use the invert pre-processor for a different variation of results. 768 is the preferred resolution for generation since it allows for more detail.
Make sure to look up additional info on how to use controlnet if you get stuck, once you have the webui up and running its really easy to install the controlnet extension aswell.",computer-vision,image-to-image,https://huggingface.co/DionTimmer/controlnet_qrcode-control_v11p_sd21,,License: openrail++,,English,Diffusers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 34,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 5975,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 6.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 6

Unlike recent work on 3D generative models which produce a single output representation, Shap-E directly generates the parameters of implicit functions that can be rendered as both textured meshes and neural radiance fields. We train Shap-E in two stages: first, we train an encoder that deterministically maps 3D assets into the parameters of an implicit function; second, we train a conditional diffusion model on outputs of the encoder. When trained on a large dataset of paired 3D and text data, our resulting models are capable of generating complex and diverse 3D assets in a matter of seconds. When compared to Point-E, an explicit generative model over point clouds, Shap-E converges faster and reaches comparable or better sample quality despite modeling a higher-dimensional, multi-representation output space.

The openassistant-guanaco dataset was further trimmed to within 2 standard deviations of token size for input and output pairs and all non-english data has been removed to reduce training size requirements.; Version 1.1 showcases notable enhancements, employing a modified version of the previous openassistant-guanaco dataset. This dataset underwent a comprehensive revision, replacing every single answer with those generated by GPT-4.; The volume of the datasets has also been augmented by approximately 50%, with a particular focus on high school and abstract algebra. This expansion leveraged the combined capabilities of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo. The initial evaluation of algebraic functions over 12 epochs indicated promising results from this enriched dataset. However, this is just the beginning; further refinements are in the pipeline, aiming to optimize the dataset quality and subsequently decrease the number of epochs required to achieve comparable results.; Considering the need to curtail memory consumption during training, this dataset was tailored to consist solely of English language questions and answers. Consequently, the model's performance in language translation may not be up to par. Nevertheless, the focus remains on enhancing the model's proficiency and efficiency within its defined scope.; This model is designed to be used for a wide array of text generation tasks that require understanding and generating English text. The model is expected to perform well in tasks such as answering questions, writing essays, summarizing text, translation, and more. However, given the specific data processing and finetuning done, it might be particularly effective for tasks related to English language question-answering systems.",natural-language-processing,text-generation,https://huggingface.co/LoupGarou/WizardCoder-Guanaco-15B-V1.1,,License: apache-2.0,Datasets: guanaco,English,PyTorch; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 3,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 73,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 31.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 0

Two heads are added on top of the decoder outputs in order to perform object detection: a linear layer for the class labels and a MLP (multi-layer perceptron) for the bounding boxes. The model uses so-called object queries to detect objects in an image. Each object query looks for a particular object in the image. For COCO, the number of object queries is set to 100. ; The model is trained using a ""bipartite matching loss"": one compares the predicted classes + bounding boxes of each of the N = 100 object queries to the ground truth annotations, padded up to the same length N (so if an image only contains 4 objects, 96 annotations will just have a ""no object"" as class and ""no bounding box"" as bounding box). The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to create an optimal one-to-one mapping between each of the N queries and each of the N annotations.

Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled datasets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new ¡°Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus¡±, we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. To facilitate future work on transfer learning for NLP, we release our dataset, pre-trained models, and code.; ; Dataset ID: wikisql from  Huggingface/NLP",natural-language-processing,text2text-generation,https://huggingface.co/mrm8488/t5-base-finetuned-wikiSQL,Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf,License: apache-2.0,Datasets: wikisql,English,PyTorch; JAX; Transformers,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c04e110d6b76f9eed4a03b_heart-icon%20(1).svg,likes 35,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fbd8519be7a7b8243bb_download_icon.svg,downloads 3847,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fc92b95cbe3c8785fb1_size_icon.svg,model size 2.0GB,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64bcb453e3df2ded5d02d93f/64c05fce61bda9e68fed4508_usage_icon.svg,usage 1

It was introduced in the paper Vision Transformers for Dense Prediction by Ranftl et al. (2021) and first released in this repository. 
DPT uses the Vision Transformer (ViT) as backbone and adds a neck + head on top for monocular depth estimation.
; The model card has been written in combination by the Hugging Face team and Intel.; Here is how to use this model for zero-shot depth estimation on an image:; For more code examples, we refer to the documentation.; Table 1.
